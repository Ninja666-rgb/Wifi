Genesis\n\nGenesis 1\n\n1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\n1:2 But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters.\n1:3 And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.\n1:4 And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.\n1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.\n1:6 And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.\n1:7 And God made the expanse and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse, and it was so.\n1:8 And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.\n1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.\n1:10 And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good.\n1:11 And God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them upon the earth; and it was so.\n1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with their seed in them according to their kind; and God saw that it was good.\n1:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n1:14 And God said, Let there be lightbearers in the expanse of heaven to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years;\n1:15 And let them be lightbearers in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth; and it was so.\n1:16 And God made the two great lightbearers, the greater lightbearer to rule the day and the lesser lightbearer to rule the night, and the stars.\n1:17 And God set them in the expanse of heaven to give light on the earth\n1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night and to separate the light from the darkness, and God saw that it was good.\n1:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n1:20 And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living animals, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of heaven.\n1:21 And God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.\n1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.\n1:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth living animals according to their kind, cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind; and it was so.\n1:25 And God made the animals of the earth according to their kind and the cattle according to their kind and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.\n1:26  And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.\n1:27 And God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.\n1:28 And God blessed them; and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of heaven and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.\n1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be for you as food.\n1:30 And to every animal of the earth and to every bird of heaven and to everything that creeps upon the earth, in which is a living soul, I have given every green herb for food; and it was so.\n1:31 And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.\n\nGenesis 2\n\n2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished.\n2:2 And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.\n2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.\n2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. When Jehovah God made earth and heaven,\n2:5 And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung upfor Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to work the ground,\n2:6 But a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground\n2:7 Jehovah God formed man with the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.\n2:8 And Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there He put the man whom He had formed.\n2:9 And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\n2:10 And a river went forth from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four branches.\n2:11 The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.\n2:12 And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.\n2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that goes around the whole land of Cush.\n2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one that goes east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n2:15 And Jehovah God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.\n2:16 And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may eat freely,\n2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.\n2:18 And Jehovah God said, It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart.\n2:19  And Jehovah God formed from the ground every animal of the field and every bird of heaven, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called any living animal, that was its name.\n2:20 And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of heaven and to every animal of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper as his counterpart.\n2:21 And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.\n2:22 And Jehovah God built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman and brought her to the man.\n2:23 And the man said, This time this is bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; This one shall be called Woman Because out of Man this one was taken.\n2:24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.\n2:25 And both the man and his wife were naked and were not ashamed before each other.\n\nGenesis 3\n\n3:1 Now the serpent was more crafty than every other animal of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?\n3:2 And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;\n3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.\n3:4 And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die!\n3:5 For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil.\n3:6  And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make oneself wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.\n3:7 And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.\n3:8 And they heard the sound of Jehovah God walking about in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God among the trees of the garden.\n3:9 And Jehovah God called to the man and said to him, Where are you?\n3:10 And he said, I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I am naked; so I hid myself.\n3:11 And He said, Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?\n3:12 And the man said, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate.\n3:13 And Jehovah God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.\n3:14 And Jehovah God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all the cattle And more than all the animals of the field: Upon your stomach you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your life.\n3:15 And I will put enmity Between you and the woman And between your seed and her seed; He will bruise you on the head, But you will bruise him on the heel.\n3:16 To the woman He said, I will greatly multiply Your pain in your childbearing; In pain you will bring forth children. And your desire will be to your husband, And he will rule over you.\n3:17  And to Adam He said, Because you listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree concerning which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat of it; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil will you eat of it All the days of your life.\n3:18 And thorns and thistles it will bring forth for you, And you will eat the herb of the field;\n3:19 By the sweat of your face You will eat bread Until you return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For dust you are, And to dust you shall return.\n3:20 And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.\n3:21 And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins and clothed them.\n3:22 And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever\n3:23 Therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he was taken.\n3:24 So He drove the man out, and at the east of the garden of Eden He placed the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.\n\nGenesis 4\n\n4:1 And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain and said, I have acquired a man, Jehovah.\n4:2 And again she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a tender of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\n4:3 And in the course of time Cain brought an offering to Jehovah from the fruit of the ground.\n4:4 And Abel also brought an offering from the firstlings of his flock, that is, from their fat portions. And Jehovah had regard for Abel and for his offering.\n4:5  But for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. And Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.\n4:6 And Jehovah said to Cain, Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?\n4:7 If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and his desire is for you, but you must rule over him.\n4:8 And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.\n4:9 Then Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?\n4:10 And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to Me from the ground.\n4:11 And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.\n4:12 When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.\n4:13 And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.\n4:14 Now You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\n4:15 And Jehovah said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah put a mark on Cain, so that anyone who found him would not strike him.\n4:16 And Cain went forth from the presence of Jehovah and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.\n4:17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.\n4:18  And Irad was born to Enoch, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.\n4:19 And Lamech took two wives for himself: The name of the first was Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.\n4:20 And Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise cattle.\n4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.\n4:22 And Zillah also gave birth to Tubalcain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron; and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.\n4:23 And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice; O wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech; For I have slain a man for wounding me, Even a young man for striking me.\n4:24 If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventysevenfold.\n4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she gave birth to a son and called his name Seth; for, she said, God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain slew him.\n4:26 And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of Jehovah.\n\nGenesis 5\n\n5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created Adam, He made him in the likeness of God.\n5:2 Male and female He created them, and He blessed them and called their name Adam, on the day when they were created.\n5:3 And Adam lived one hundred thirty years and begot a son in his likeness according to his image, and he called his name Seth.\n5:4  And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years, "));

Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generations; and Noah walked with God.\n6:10 And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n6:11 And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.\n6:12 And God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.\n6:13 And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and now I am about to destroy them with the earth.\n6:14 Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make rooms in the ark and shall cover it within and without with pitch.\n6:15  And this is how you shall make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.\n6:16 You shall make an opening for light for the ark, and you shall finish it up to a cubit from the top; and you shall put the entrance of the ark in its side; you shall make it with lower, second, and third stories.\n6:17 And now I am about to bring a flood of water upon the earth to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.\n6:18 But I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.\n6:19 And of every living thing, of all flesh, two of every kind you shall bring into the ark to preserve them alive with you; they shall be male and female.\n6:20 Of the birds according to their kind and of the cattle according to their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind will come to you in order to preserve them alive.\n6:21 And for your part, take some of every kind of food that is edible, and gather it to yourself, and it will be for food for you and for them.\n6:22 And Noah did this; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.\n\nGenesis 7\n\n7:1 Then Jehovah said to Noah, Come into the ark, you and all your household, for you alone I have seen to be righteous before Me in this generation.\n7:2 Of every clean animal you shall take with you seven pairs, a male and its female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and its female;\n7:3 Also of the birds of heaven, seven pairs, male and female; to preserve their offspring alive on the surface of all the earth.\n7:4  For in seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living being that I have made I will blot out from the surface of the ground.\n7:5 And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him.\n7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.\n7:7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark because of the waters of the flood.\n7:8 Of clean animals and of animals that are not clean and of birds and of everything that creeps upon the ground,\n7:9 Two by two they came into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.\n7:10 And after the seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.\n7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that very day all the springs of the great deep burst open, and the windows of heaven were opened.\n7:12 And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.\n7:13 On that very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the ark,\n7:14 They and every animal according to its kind and all the cattle according to their kind and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth according to its kind and every bird according to its kindevery bird, every winged creature.\n7:15 And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two of all flesh in which was the breath of life.\n7:16 And those who went in, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and Jehovah shut the door behind him.\n7:17 And the flood was on the earth forty days; and the waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.\n7:18 And the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went about on the surface of the waters.\n7:19 And when the waters had prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, all the high mountains that were under the entire heaven were covered.\n7:20 The waters prevailed fifteen cubits higher once the mountains were covered.\n7:21 And all flesh that moved upon the earth expired: birds and cattle and animals and every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth and all mankind.\n7:22 Everything in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.\n7:23 Thus He blotted out every living being that was upon the surface of the ground, from man to beast to creeping things to the birds of heaven. And they were blotted out from the earth, and only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ark.\n7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred fifty days.\n\nGenesis 8\n\n8:1 And God remembered Noah and all the animals and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.\n8:2 The springs of the deep and the windows of heaven were also stopped, and the rain from the heavens was restrained;\n8:3 And the waters receded steadily from upon the earth. So at the end of one hundred fifty days the waters began to diminish.\n8:4 And the ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.\n8:5 And the waters diminished steadily until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.\n8:6 And at the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.\n8:7 And he sent out the raven; and it went out, going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth.\n8:8 And he sent out the dove from him to see if the waters had abated from the surface of the ground.\n8:9 But the dove found no resting place for the sole of her foot, so she returned to him to the ark; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth. And he put out his hand and took her and brought her to himself into the ark.\n8:10 And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark.\n8:11 And the dove came to him toward evening time, and there in her beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had abated from the earth.\n8:12 And he waited yet another seven days and sent out the dove, and she did not return to him again.\n8:13 And in the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the water was dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that now the surface of the ground was dry.\n8:14 And in the second month, on the twentyseventh day of the month, the earth was dry.\n8:15 And God spoke to Noah, saying,\n8:16 Go forth from the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you;\n8:17 Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all fleshbirds and cattle and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earththat they may swarm on the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.\n8:18 So Noah went forth, as well as his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.\n8:19  Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves upon the earth, went forth from the ark according to their families.\n8:20 And Noah built an altar to Jehovah and took of every clean beast and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar.\n8:21 And Jehovah smelled the satisfying fragrance; and Jehovah said in His heart, I will never again curse the ground on account of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; nor will I ever again smite everything living as I have done.\n8:22 Throughout all the days that earth remains, Seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, And summer and winter, and day and night Shall not cease.\n\nGenesis 9\n\n9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.\n9:2 And the fear of you and the terror of you shall be upon every animal of the earth and upon every bird of heaven, on everything that creeps on the ground and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.\n9:3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; just as I gave you the green herb, so I have given you everything.\n9:4 But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you shall not eat.\n9:5 And indeed your lifeblood I will require; from every animal I will require it. And from every man, from every man's brother, I will require the life of man.\n9:6 Whoever sheds man's blood, By man shall his blood be shed, For in the image of God He made man.\n9:7 And you, be fruitful and multiply, Abound on the earth and multiply in it.\n9:8 Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,\n9:9  And I Myself now establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you\n9:10 And with every living animal that is with you: the birds, the cattle, and every animal of the earth with you, of all that came out of the ark, every animal of the earth.\n9:11 And I establish My covenant with you, that never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.\n9:12 And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living animal that is with you, for perpetual generations:\n9:13 I set My bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth.\n9:14 And when I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow is seen in the clouds,\n9:15 I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living animal of all flesh, and never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.\n9:16 And the bow will be in the clouds, and I will look upon it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living animal of all flesh that is upon the earth.\n9:17 And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.\n9:18 Now the sons of Noah who came forth from the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth. And Ham was the father of Canaan.\n9:19 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was spread over.\n9:20 And Noah began to be a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.\n9:21 And he drank of the wine and became drunk.

And at that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites dwelt in the land.\n13:8 And Abram said to Lot, Let there please be no strife between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.\n13:9 Is not the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.\n13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw the entire plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywherethis was before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrahlike the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.\n13:11 So Lot chose for himself the entire plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves from each other.\n13:12 Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom.\n13:13 Now the men of Sodom were very wicked and sinful toward Jehovah.\n13:14 And Jehovah said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, Now lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward;\n13:15 For all the land that you see I will give to you and to your seed forever.\n13:16 And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed can also be numbered.\n13:17  Rise up; walk through the land according to its length and its breadth, for I will give it to you.\n13:18 And Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to Jehovah.\n\nGenesis 14\n\n14:1 And in the days of Amraphel the king of Shinar, Arioch the king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and Tidal the king of Goiim,\n14:2 These kings made war with Bera the king of Sodom and with Birsha the king of Gomorrah, Shinab the king of Admah, and Shemeber the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).\n14:3 All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).\n14:4 Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.\n14:5 And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and struck the Rephaim in Ashterothkarnaim and the Zuzim in Ham and the Emim in Shavehkiriathaim\n14:6 And the Horites in Mount Seir as far as Elparan, which is by the wilderness.\n14:7 And they turned back and came to Enmishpat (that is, Kadesh), and struck all the country of the Amalekites and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazazontamar.\n14:8 And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went forth and set the battle in array against them in the valley of Siddim,\n14:9 Against Chedorlaomer the king of Elam and Tidal the king of Goiim and Amraphel the king of Shinar and Arioch the king of Ellasar, four kings against the five.\n14:10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; and they fell there, but those who survived fled to the hill country.\n14:11 And they took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food and went away.\n14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, and his possessions and departed, for he was dwelling in Sodom.\n14:13 And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was dwelling by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.\n14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother had been taken captive, he led out his trained men, born in his house, three hundred eighteen of them, and pursued as far as Dan.\n14:15 And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and struck them and pursued them to Hobah, which is north of Damascus.\n14:16 And he brought back all the possessions and also brought back Lot his brother and his possessions as well as the women and the people.\n14:17 And after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).\n14:18 And Melchizedek the king of Salem brought out bread and wine.

And Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind Him.\n18:11  Now Abraham and Sarah were old and advanced in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah according to the manner of women.\n18:12 And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have become old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n18:13 And Jehovah said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I indeed bear a child, when I am old?\n18:14 Is anything too marvelous for Jehovah? At the appointed time I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\n18:15 Then Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And He said, No, but you did laugh.\n18:16 And the men rose up from there and looked down upon Sodom; and Abraham walked with them to send them away.\n18:17 And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,\n18:18 Since Abraham will indeed become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?\n18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of Jehovah by doing righteousness and justice, that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken concerning him.\n18:20 And Jehovah said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, how great it is; and their sin, how very heavy it is!\n18:21 I shall go down and see whether they have done altogether according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know.\n18:22 And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before Jehovah.\n18:23 And Abraham came near and said, Will You indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?\n18:24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?\n18:25 Far be it from You to do such a thing, to put to death the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked. Far be it from You! Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justly?\n18:26 And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.\n18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Now behold, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord, though I am but dust and ashes.\n18:28 Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will You destroy the whole city because of five? And He said, I will not destroy it if I find fortyfive there.\n18:29 And he spoke to Him yet again and said, Suppose forty are found there? And He said, I will not do it because of forty.\n18:30 And he said, Oh may the Lord not be angry if I speak. Suppose thirty are found there? And He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.\n18:31 And he said, Now behold, I have taken it upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there? And He said, I will not destroy it because of twenty.\n18:32 And he said, Oh let the Lord not be angry if I speak yet once more. Suppose ten are found there? And He said, I will not destroy it because of ten.\n18:33 And Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.\n\nGenesis 19\n\n19:1 And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom.

But they said, No; we will spend the night in the square.\n19:3 But he urged them strongly, and they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.\n19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;\n19:5 And they called to Lot and said to him, Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them.\n19:6 And Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him.\n19:7 And he said, Please, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.\n19:8 I have here two daughters who have not known a man. Please, let me bring them out to you, and do to them as is fitting in your eyes; only do not do anything to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof.\n19:9 But they said, Stand aside. Then they said, This one came here to sojourn, and already he is acting like a judge."));

And they pressed hard against the man, against Lot, and came near in order to break down the door.\n19:10 But the men stretched out their hand and brought Lot into the house to them and shut the door.\n19:11 And they struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the entrance.\n19:12 And the men said to Lot, Whom else do you have here? A soninlaw or your sons and your daughters or anyone you have in the citybring them out of the place.\n19:13 For we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before Jehovah that Jehovah has sent us to destroy it.\n19:14  And Lot went out and spoke to his sonsinlaw, who were to marry his daughters, and said, Rise up; go forth from this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city. But it seemed to his sonsinlaw as though he were joking.\n19:15 And when the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, Rise up; take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be destroyed in the iniquity of the city.\n19:16 But he lingered; so the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.\n19:17 And when they had brought them outside, He said, Escape for your life. Do not look behind you, neither stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the hills, lest you be destroyed.\n19:18 And Lot said to them, May it not be so, Lord;\n19:19 Even though Your servant has found favor in Your sight, and You have magnified Your lovingkindness, which You have showed to me in preserving my life; I cannot escape to the mountain, lest the disaster overtake me and I die.\n19:20 Here, this city is nearby to flee to, and it is a little one. Please let me escape thereis it not a little one?and I shall live.\n19:21 And He said to him, I now grant you this request also, that I will not overthrow the city concerning which you have spoken.\n19:22 Hurry, escape there; for I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.\n19:23 The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar.\n19:24 Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven.\n19:25 And He overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and what grew on the ground.\n19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\n19:27 And Abraham rose up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Jehovah.\n19:28 And he looked down upon Sodom and Gomorrah and upon all the land of the plain. And as he looked, there it was: the smoke of the land was going up like the smoke of a furnace.\n19:29 And when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out from the middle of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities among which Lot dwelt.\n19:30 Then Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountains, and his two daughters with him, for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he and his two daughters dwelt in a cave.\n19:31 And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man on the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.\n19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine; and let us lie with him, that we may preserve alive seed from our father.\n19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.\n19:34 And the next day the firstborn said to the younger, I have now lain with my father last night. Let us make him drink wine tonight also; and you go in, and lie with him, that we may preserve alive seed from our father.\n19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger one arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.\n19:36 Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.\n19:37 And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.\n19:38 And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Benammi; he is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.\n\nGenesis 20\n\n20:1 And Abraham journeyed from there toward the region of the Negev and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; then he sojourned in Gerar.\n20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.\n20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, You are now about to die because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.\n20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her, so he said, Lord, will You slay even a righteous nation?\n20:5 Did he himself not say to me, She is my sister? And even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.\n20:6 And God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also prevented you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not let you touch her.\n20:7 Now therefore return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.\n20:8 And Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and spoke all these things in their hearing. And the men were very afraid.\n20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.\n20:10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing?\n20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will slay me because of my wife.\n20:12 But she is also truly my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.\n20:13 And when God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, This is your kindness which you must do to me: At every place where we go, say of me, He is my brother.\n20:14 Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham; and he returned to him Sarah his wife.\n20:15 And Abimelech said, My land is now before you; dwell wherever it pleases you.\n20:16 And to Sarah he said, I have now given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is now your vindication before all who are with you. And in every respect you have been cleared.\n20:17 And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female servants, so that they bore children.\n20:18 For Jehovah had completely shut up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.\n\nGenesis 21\n\n21:1 And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did to Sarah as He had promised.\n21:2 And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.\n21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.\n21:4 And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.\n21:5 And Abraham was a hundred years old when Isaac his son was born to him.\n21:6 And Sarah said, God has made me laugh; everyone who hears will laugh with me.\n21:7 And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.\n21:8 And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.\n21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.\n21:10 So she said to Abraham, Cast out this maidservant and her son, for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son Isaac.\n21:11 And the matter displeased Abraham greatly on account of his son.\n21:12 And God said to Abraham, Do not be displeased on account of the boy and on account of your maidservant. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac shall your seed be called.\n21:13 And of the son of the maidservant I will also make a nation, because he is your seed.\n21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a waterskin full of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the child and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n21:15 When the water in the waterskin was finished, she cast the child under one of the bushes.\n21:16 And she went and sat herself down opposite him, a fair distance away, about a bowshot away, for she said, Do not let me look upon the death of the child. And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept.\n21:17 And God heard the voice of the boy. And the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said to her, What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.\n21:18 Rise up; lift up the boy, and hold him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.\n21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the waterskin with water and gave the boy a drink.\n21:20 And God was with the boy, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer.\n21:21  And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.\n21:22 And at that time Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.\n21:23 Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity. According to the kindness that I have shown to you, you shall do to me and to the land in which you have sojourned.\n21:24 And Abraham said, I swear it.\n21:25 And Abraham confronted Abimelech concerning the well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken by force.\n21:26 And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this thing; and you did not tell me about it, nor have I even heard of it until today.\n21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech. And the two of them made a covenant.\n21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n21:29 And Abimelech said to Abraham, What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set by themselves?\n21:30 And he said, These seven ewe lambs you shall take from my hand, that it may be a witness for me that I dug this well.\n21:31 Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there the two of them swore an oath.\n21:32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech rose up with Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.\n21:33 And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.\n21:34  And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.\n\nGenesis 22\n\n22:1 Now after these things God tested Abraham and said to him, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.\n22:2 And He said, Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.\n22:3 And Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went to the place of which God had told him.\n22:4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar.\n22:5 And Abraham said to his young men, Stay here with the donkey; and I and the boy will go over there, and we will worship and then return to you.\n22:6 And Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And the two of them walked together.\n22:7 And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, My father! And he said, Here I am, my son. And he said, The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\n22:8 And Abraham said, God Himself will provide the lamb for a burnt offering, my son. So the two of them walked on together.\n22:9 And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.\n22:10 And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.\n22:11 And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.\n22:12  And he said, Do not stretch out your hand upon the boy, nor do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.\n22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram, caught in the thicket by its horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering in place of his son.\n22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh, as it is said to this day, On the mount of Jehovah it will be provided.\n22:15 And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham a second time from the heavens\n22:16 And said, By Myself I have sworn, declares Jehovah: Because you have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son,\n22:17 I will surely bless you and will greatly multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.\n22:18 And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.\n22:19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham dwelt in Beersheba.\n22:20 And after these things it was told Abraham, saying, Milcah has now also borne children to your brother Nahor:\n22:21 Uz his firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram\n22:22 And Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel;\n22:23 And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother.\n22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.\n\nGenesis 23\n\n23:1 And the life of Sarah was one hundred twentyseven years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.\n23:2 And Sarah died in Kiriatharba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. And Abraham proceeded to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.\n23:3 Then Abraham rose up from before his dead wife and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,\n23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner among you. Give me the possession of a burial place among you that I may bury my "));

In the choicest of our burial places bury your dead wife. None of us will withhold from you his burial place for burying your dead wife.\n23:7 And Abraham rose up and bowed down to the people of the land, to the children of Heth.\n23:8 And he spoke with them, saying, If it is your desire that I should bury my dead wife out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar\n23:9 That he would give me the cave of Machpelah, which is his, and which is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your midst for the possession of a burial place.\n23:10 Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, in the hearing of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,\n23:11 No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field and the cave that is in it, to you I give it. In the presence of the children of my people I give it to you; bury your dead wife.\n23:12 And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.\n23:13 And he spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying, But if you will, please hear me; I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, that I may bury my dead wife there.\n23:14  And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,\n23:15 My lord, listen to me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? Therefore bury your dead wife.\n23:16 And Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current with the merchant.\n23:17 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah and which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field, which were in all its territory, were assured\n23:18 To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, in the presence of all who went in at the gate of his city.\n23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.\n23:20 And the field and the cave that is in it were assured to Abraham for the possession of a burial place from the children of Heth.\n\nGenesis 24\n\n24:1 And Abraham was old, and advanced in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.\n24:2 And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put your hand under my thigh;\n24:3 And I will make you swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am dwelling.\n24:4 But you shall go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.\n24:5 And the servant said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I then take your son back to the land from where you came?\n24:6 And Abraham said to him, Be certain not to take my son back there.\n24:7 Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land, He will send His angel before you; and you shall take a wife for my son from there.\n24:8 And if the woman is not willing to follow you, you shall be free from this oath of mine; only you shall not take my son back there.\n24:9 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.\n24:10 And the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and departed, having all kinds of his master's good things in his hand. And he rose up and went to Aramnaharaim, to the city of Nahor.\n24:11 And he made the camels to kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, at the time when women go out to draw water.\n24:12 And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, Please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.\n24:13 I am standing here by the spring of water as the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.\n24:14 And may it be that the girl to whom I say, Please let down your pitcher that I may drink, and who says, Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink, may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant, for Isaac; and in this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.\n24:15 But before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, coming out with her pitcher upon her shoulder.\n24:16 And the girl was very beautiful in appearance, a virgin, and no man had known her. And she went down to the spring and filled her pitcher and came up.\n24:17  And the servant ran to meet her and said, Please let me sip a little water from your pitcher.\n24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried and lowered her pitcher on her hand and gave him a drink.\n24:19 And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have finished drinking.\n24:20 And she hurried and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again to the well to draw water, and she drew it for all his camels.\n24:21 And the man gazed fixedly upon her in silence to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.\n24:22 And when the camels had finished drinking, the man took a golden nosering weighing half a shekel and two bracelets for her hands weighing ten gold shekels,\n24:23 And said, Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?\n24:24 And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.\n24:25 She also said to him, We have plenty of straw and fodder and also a place to lodge in.\n24:26 And the man bowed and worshipped Jehovah.\n24:27 And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His lovingkindness and His faithfulness toward my master. As for me, Jehovah has led me in the way to the house of my master's brothers.\n24:28 And the girl ran and told her mother's house about these things.\n24:29 And Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring.\n24:30  As soon as he had seen the ring and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, This is what the man spoke to me, he went to the man. And there he was, standing by the camels at the spring.\n24:31 And he said, Come in, O blessed of Jehovah! Why do you stand outside when I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?\n24:32 And the man came into the house, and Laban unloaded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder to the camels and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.\n24:33 And food was set before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat until I have told my business. And he said, Speak on.\n24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.\n24:35 And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he has become great. And He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.\n24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master after she had become old. And he has given all that he has to him.\n24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.\n24:38 But you shall go to my father's house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.\n24:39 And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.\n24:40 And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send His angel with you and make your journey prosperous. And you shall take a wife for my son from my family, even from my father's house.\n24:41 Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my family. And if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.\n24:42  And I came today to the spring and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now You make my journey on which I go prosperous,\n24:43 I am standing here by the spring of water, so let the maiden who comes out to draw water, to whom I will say, Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,\n24:44 And she will say to me, Drink, and I will also draw water for your camelslet her be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my master's son.\n24:45 Before I had finished speaking in my heart, there came Rebekah, and her pitcher was on her shoulder. And she went down to the spring and drew water. And I said to her, Please let me drink.\n24:46 And she hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said, Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink. So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink.\n24:47 And I asked her and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the nosering upon her nose and the bracelets upon her hands.\n24:48 And I bowed and worshipped Jehovah and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son.\n24:49 And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me so; but if not, tell me so, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.\n24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The matter comes from Jehovah; we cannot speak to you bad or good.\n24:51 Here is Rebekah before you: Take her, and go; and let her be the wife of your master's son, as Jehovah has spoken.\n24:52 And when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed down to the earth to Jehovah.\n24:53 And the servant brought forth silver jewelry and gold jewelry and clothing and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.\n24:54  And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and spent the night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.\n24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the girl stay with us a few days, ten or so; after that she may go.\n24:56 And he said to them, Do not delay me, since Jehovah has made my journey prosperous. Send me away that I may go to my master.\n24:57 And they said, Let us call the girl and ask her.\n24:58 And they called Rebekah and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.\n24:59 So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men.\n24:60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, May you, our sister, become Thousands of ten thousands, And may your seed possess The gate of those who hate them.\n24:61 And Rebekah arose with her maids, and they rode on the camels and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah and went away.\n24:62 Now Isaac had come from going to Beerlahairoi, for he was dwelling in the region of the Negev.\n24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening. And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.\n24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes; and when she saw Isaac, she sprang off the camel.\n24:65 And she said to the servant, Who is this man who is walking in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil and covered herself.\n24:66 And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.\n24:67 And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother. And he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after the death of his mother.\n\nGenesis 25\n\n25:1 And Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.\n25:2 And she bore him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah.\n25:3 And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurim and the Letushim and the Leummim.\n25:4 And the sons of Midian: Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.\n25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.\n25:6 But to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was still living, eastward to the east country.\n25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, one hundred seventyfive years.\n25:8 And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full of days, and he was gathered to his people.\n25:9 And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which faces Mamre,\n25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife.\n25:11 And after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beerlahairoi.\n25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's female servant, bore to Abraham.\n25:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam\n25:14 And Mishma and Dumah and Massa;\n25:15 Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.\n25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their peoples.\n25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred thirtyseven years. And he expired and died and was gathered to his people.\n25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which faces Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He settled down opposite all his brothers.\n25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac.\n25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddanaram, the sister of Laban the Aramaean, to be his wife.\n25:21 And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.\n25:22 And the children struggled with each other within her. And she said, If it is so, why am I like this? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.\n25:23 And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in your womb, And two peoples shall be separated from your bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the older shall serve the younger.\n25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.\n25:25 And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.\n25:26 And after that his brother came forth, and his hand was holding on to Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore "));

And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.\n25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Let me swallow down some of the red stew, that red stew there, for I am faint. Therefore his name was called Edom.\n25:31 And Jacob said, First sell me your birthright.\n25:32 And Esau said, I am now about to die, so of what use is this birthright to me?\n25:33 And Jacob said, First swear to me. And he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.\n25:34 And Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.\n\nGenesis 26\n\n26:1 And there was a famine in the land, besides the former famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Abimelech the king of the Philistines at Gerar.\n26:2 And Jehovah appeared to him and said, Do not go down to Egypt; dwell in the land of which I will tell you.\n26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will bless you; for to you and to your seed I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.\n26:4 And I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and will give to your seed all these lands; and in your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed,\n26:5 Because Abraham obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.\n26:6  So Isaac dwelt in Gerar.\n26:7 And the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, She is my sister, for he was afraid to say, My wife, thinking, The men of this place might slay me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful in appearance.\n26:8 And when he had been there a long time, Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked out through his window and saw, and there was Isaac playfully caressing Rebekah his wife.\n26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac and said, So she is indeed your wife. How then did you say, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I thought I might die on account of her.\n26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.\n26:11 And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He who touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n26:12 And Isaac sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him,\n26:13 And the man became rich and continued to grow richer until he became very rich.\n26:14 And he had possessions of flocks and possessions of herds and a great household, so that the Philistines envied him.\n26:15 Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father the Philistines had stopped up and filled with earth.\n26:16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.\n26:17 So Isaac went away from there and camped in the valley of Gerar and dwelt there.\n26:18 And Isaac dug again the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, and which the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham; and he called them by the same names which his father had given them.\n26:19  And Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing water.\n26:20 And the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds, saying, The water is ours. So he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.\n26:21 And they dug another well; and they strove over that also, so he called the name of it Sitnah.\n26:22 And he moved away from there and dug another well, but they did not strive over it, so he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, Now Jehovah has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.\n26:23 And he went up from there to Beersheba.\n26:24 And Jehovah appeared to him the same night and said, I am the God of Abraham your father. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, and I will bless you and multiply your seed for My servant Abraham's sake.\n26:25 And he built an altar there and called upon the name of Jehovah and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants dug a well.\n26:26 And Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the captain of his army.\n26:27 And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?\n26:28 And they said, We see plainly that Jehovah is with you; so we say, Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you,\n26:29 That you will not do us any harm, just as we have not touched you, and just as we have done to you nothing but good and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed of Jehovah.\n26:30 And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank.\n26:31 And they rose up early in the morning and swore to one another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.\n26:32  And the same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well which they had dug and said to him, We have found water.\n26:33 And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.\n26:34 Now when Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.\n26:35 And they caused bitterness of spirit to Isaac and to Rebekah.\n\nGenesis 27\n\n27:1 Now when Isaac was old, and his eyes had become so dim that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, My son. And he said to him, Here I am.\n27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, and I do not know the day of my death.\n27:3 Now then, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me,\n27:4 And prepare for me a tasty meal, such as I love, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.\n27:5 Now Rebekah had been listening when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game to bring it home,\n27:6 Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, I just heard your father speaking to Esau your brother, saying,\n27:7 Bring me game, and prepare for me a tasty meal so that I may eat it and bless you before Jehovah before my death.\n27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command you.\n27:9 Go now to the flock, and take two choice kids for me from there, and I will prepare them as a tasty meal for your father, such as he loves.\n27:10 Then you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death.\n27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.\n27:12 Perhaps my father will feel me, and I will be as a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.\n27:13 And his mother said to him, Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, get them for me.\n27:14 And he went and got them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared a tasty meal, such as his father loved.\n27:15 And Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son.\n27:16 And she put the skins of the kids on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.\n27:17 And she put the tasty meal and the bread that she had prepared into the hand of Jacob her son.\n27:18 And he came to his father and said, My father. And he said, Here I am. Who are you, my son?\n27:19 And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your firstborn; I have done as you told me. Now rise up; sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.\n27:20 And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah your God put it in my way.\n27:21 And Isaac said to Jacob, Please come near that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.\n27:22 And Jacob came near to Isaac his father. And he felt him and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are Esau's hands.\n27:23  And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.\n27:24 And he said, Are you really my son Esau? And he said, I am.\n27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's game, that I may bless you. So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.\n27:26 Then his father Isaac said to him, Please come near and kiss me, my son.\n27:27 So he came near and kissed him; and when Isaac smelled the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said, See, the smell of my sonLike the smell of a field Which Jehovah has blessed.\n27:28 And may God give you Of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth, And an abundance of grain and new wine.\n27:29 Let peoples serve you, And nations bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, And let your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, And blessed be those who bless you.\n27:30 And as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.\n27:31 And he also had prepared a tasty meal and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, Let my father rise up, and eat some of his son's game, that you may bless me.\n27:32 And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.\n27:33 And Isaac trembled very greatly and said, Who was it then who hunted game and brought it to me, so that I ate of it all before you came and blessed him? And blessed will he be.\n27:34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a very great and bitter cry and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n27:35 And he said, Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing.\n27:36  And Esau said, Is he not rightly named Jacob, for he has supplanted me these two times? He took away my birthright, and behold now he has taken away my blessing. Then he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?\n27:37 And Isaac answered and said to Esau, I have already made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. And what then shall I do for you, my son?\n27:38 And Esau said to his father, Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.\n27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, And away from the dew of heaven from above.\n27:40 And by your sword shall you live, And you shall serve your brother. And when you become restless, You shall break his yoke from off your neck.\n27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will slay my brother Jacob.\n27:42 And the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah, so she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, Now your brother Esau is consoling himself concerning you by planning to kill you.\n27:43 Therefore, my son, obey my voice now, and rise up; flee to Laban my brother at Haran,\n27:44 And stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away,\n27:45 Until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send word and get you back from there. Why should I be bereaved of both of you in one day?\n27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth like these, from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?\n\nGenesis 28\n\n28:1 And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him; and he charged him and said to him, You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.\n28:2 Rise up, go to Paddanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take from there a wife from the daughters of Laban your mother's brother.\n28:3 And may the Allsufficient God bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.\n28:4 And may He give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed with you, that you may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.\n28:5 And Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddanaram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramaean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.\n28:6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Paddanaram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him, he charged him, saying, You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,\n28:7 And that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddanaram.\n28:8 So Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan displeased Isaac his father.\n28:9 Then Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, and the sister of Nebaioth to be his wife, in addition to the wives that he had.\n28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.\n28:11 And he came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set; and he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and he lay down in that place.\n28:12 And he dreamed: There was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.\n28:13 And there was Jehovah, standing above it; and He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give to you and to your seed.\n28:14 And your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.\n28:15 And, behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will cause you to return to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.\n28:16 And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it.\n28:17 And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.\n28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.\n28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz previously.\n28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and "));

And the stone on the mouth of the well was large.\n29:3 And when all the flocks would gather there, they would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep; then they would put the stone back on the mouth of the well in its place.\n29:4 And Jacob said to them, My brothers, where are you from? And they said, We are from Haran.\n29:5 And he said to them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We do know him.\n29:6 And he said to them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well, and here is his daughter Rachel coming with the sheep.\n29:7 And he said, Look, it is still full day; and it is not time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep, and go feed them.\n29:8 And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.\n29:9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with the sheep which belonged to her father, for she was a shepherdess.\n29:10 Now when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob drew near and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.\n29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted up his voice and wept.\n29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's relative and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.\n29:13 And when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him. And he embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then Jacob related to Laban all these things.\n29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him a month.\n29:15 And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?\n29:16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n29:17  And Leah's eyes were dull, but Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance.\n29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.\n29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to another man; stay with me.\n29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but they seemed to him only a few days because of the love he had for her.\n29:21 And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed.\n29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast.\n29:23 But in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went in to her.\n29:24 And Laban gave Zilpah his female servant to his daughter Leah to be her female servant.\n29:25 And in the morning there she was, Leah! And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?\n29:26 And Laban said, It is not done in this way in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.\n29:27 Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for another seven years.\n29:28 And Jacob did so and completed her week, and he gave him Rachel his daughter as a wife.\n29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his female servant to be her female servant.\n29:30 And he went in also to Rachel and also loved Rachel rather than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years.\n29:31 Now when Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.\n29:32  And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, Because Jehovah has looked upon my affliction, surely now my husband will love me.\n29:33 And she conceived again and bore a son and said, Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated, He has therefore given me this son also; so she called his name Simeon.\n29:34 And she conceived again and bore a son and said, Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore his name was called Levi.\n29:35 And she conceived again and bore a son and said, This time I will praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. Then she ceased bearing.\n\nGenesis 30\n\n30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.\n30:2 And Jacob's anger burned against Rachel, and he said, Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?\n30:3 And she said, Here is my servant Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear upon my knees and that I also may have children through her.\n30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her female servant as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.\n30:5 And Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.\n30:6 And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice and given me a son; therefore she called his name Dan.\n30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's female servant conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.\n30:8 And Rachel said, In wrestling with God, I have wrestled with my sister and have prevailed; so she called his name Naphtali.\n30:9  Now when Leah saw that she ceased bearing, she took Zilpah her female servant and gave her to Jacob as a wife.\n30:10 And Zilpah Leah's female servant bore Jacob a son.\n30:11 And Leah said, How fortunate! So she called his name Gad.\n30:12 And Zilpah Leah's female servant bore Jacob a second son.\n30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I! For the daughters will call me blessed; so she called his name Asher.\n30:14 And Reuben went out in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Please give me some of your son's mandrakes.\n30:15 And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? And would you take away my son's mandrakes also? So Rachel said, Then he may lie with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes.\n30:16 And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, You must come in to me, for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes. So he lay with her that night.\n30:17 And God gave heed to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.\n30:18 And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I gave my female servant to my husband; so she called his name Issachar.\n30:19 And Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.\n30:20 And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons; so she called his name Zebulun.\n30:21 And afterward she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.\n30:22 Then God remembered Rachel, and God gave heed to her and opened her womb.\n30:23  And she conceived and bore a son and said, God has taken away my reproach.\n30:24 And she called his name Joseph, saying, May Jehovah add to me another son.\n30:25 And when Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.\n30:26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go; for you indeed know my service by which I have served you.\n30:27 And Laban said to him, If you please, I have divined that Jehovah has blessed me on account of you.\n30:28 And he said, Name me your wages, and I will give it.\n30:29 And Jacob said to him, You indeed know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.\n30:30 For you had little before I came, and it has spread into a multitude, and Jehovah has blessed you wherever I turned. But now when shall I provide for my own house also?\n30:31 And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything. Just do this one thing for me: Let me again feed your flock and keep it.\n30:32 Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted animal, that is, every black animal among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such will be my wages.\n30:33 So my righteousness will testify for me later, when you come concerning my wages, by what is before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the sheep, if found with me, will be counted stolen.\n30:34 And Laban said, Fine; let it be according to your word.\n30:35 But on that day he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;\n30:36 And he set a distance of a three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n30:37 And Jacob took rods of fresh poplar and almond and plane trees and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.\n30:38 And he set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, in the watering places where the flocks came to drink; and they bred when they came to drink.\n30:39 And the flocks bred before the rods; and the flocks brought forth young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.\n30:40 And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flock toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban, and he put his own herds apart and did not put them with Laban's flock.\n30:41 And whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob placed the rods before the eyes of the flock in the troughs so that they might breed among the rods;\n30:42 But when the flock was feebler, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n30:43 And the man became spread out exceedingly, and had large flocks, and female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\n\nGenesis 31\n\n31:1 Now Jacob heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob has taken away all that belonged to our father; and from what belonged to our father he has made all this wealth.\n31:2 And Jacob saw Laban's countenance, and now it was not favorable toward him as previously.\n31:3 And Jehovah said to Jacob, Return to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.\n31:4  So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field,\n31:5 And he said to them, I see that your father's countenance is not favorable toward me as previously, but the God of my father has been with me.\n31:6 And you yourselves know that with all my strength I have served your father.\n31:7 And your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to harm me.\n31:8 If he spoke in this way, The speckled shall be your wages, then all the flock bore speckled; and if he spoke in this way, The streaked shall be your wages, then all the flock bore streaked.\n31:9 Thus God has taken away your father's livestock and given them to me.\n31:10 And at the time the flock was breeding, I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream; and there were the male goats, leaping upon the flockstreaked, speckled, and spotted.\n31:11 And the Angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob; and I said, Here I am.\n31:12 And He said, Lift up now your eyes, and see that all the male goats which leap upon the flock are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.\n31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to Me. Rise up now; go out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.\n31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, Do we still have any portion or inheritance in our father's house?\n31:15 Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us and has even entirely used up the money given for us.\n31:16 Surely all the wealth which God has taken away from our father is ours and our children's. So do now whatever God has said to you.\n31:17 Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;\n31:18  And he drove away all his livestock and all his property which he had acquired, the livestock in his possession which he had acquired in Paddanaram, in order to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.\n31:19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole the household idols that were her father's.\n31:20 And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramaean by not telling him that he was fleeing.\n31:21 So he fled with all that he had, and he rose up and crossed over the River and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.\n31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.\n31:23 And he took his brothers with him and pursued after him the distance of a seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the hill country of Gilead.\n31:24 And God came to Laban the Aramaean in a dream of the night and said to him, Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.\n31:25 And Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his brothers also pitched tents in the hill country of Gilead.\n31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What are you doing deceiving me and carrying away my daughters like captives of the sword?\n31:27 Why did you flee secretly and steal away from me and not tell me, when I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with tambourine and with lyre?\n31:28 And you did not allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters. Now you have acted foolishly.\n31:29 It is in my power to do you harm, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob either good or bad.\n31:30 And now, though you had to go because you longed greatly for your father's house, why did you steal my gods?\n31:31  And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I thought that you might take your daughters from me by force.\n31:32 The one with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our brothers indicate what there is with me that is yours, and take it. Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.\n31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the two female servants' tent, but he did not find them. Then he went from Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent.\n31:34 Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel's saddle, and she sat upon them. And Laban rummaged through all "));

So he searched but did not find the household idols.\n31:36 And Jacob became angry and contended with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my transgression? What is my sin, that you have so hotly pursued me?\n31:37 Although you have rummaged through all my possessions, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may decide between the two of us.\n31:38 These twenty years have I been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.\n31:39 That which was torn by beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.\n31:40 Thus I was: By day the dry heat consumed me, and the frost by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.\n31:41 These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.\n31:42  If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had not been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.\n31:43 And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters or to their children whom they have borne?\n31:44 So come now; let us make a covenant, I and you; and let it be a witness between me and you.\n31:45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.\n31:46 And Jacob said to his brothers, Gather stones. So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.\n31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.\n31:48 And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and you today. Therefore its name was called Galeed\n31:49 And Mizpah, because he said, Jehovah watch between me and you when we are absent from one another.\n31:50 If you afflict my daughters, and if you take wives besides my daughterseven though no man is with ussee, God is witness between me and you.\n31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Here is this heap, and here is the pillar which I have set between me and you.\n31:52 This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass beyond this heap to you and that you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.\n31:53 The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac.\n31:54 And Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his brothers to eat a meal, and they ate a meal and spent the night in the mountain.\n31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them, and Laban departed and returned to his place.\n\nGenesis 32\n\n32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n32:2 And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's camp. So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the field of Edom.\n32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed until now;\n32:5 And I have oxen and donkeys and flocks, and male servants and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord this, that I may find favor in your sight.\n32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and he also is coming to meet you; and four hundred men are with him.\n32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two camps;\n32:8 And he said, If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the camp which is left will escape.\n32:9 Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who said to me, Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will do you good,\n32:10 I am not worthy of all the lovingkindnesses and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant, for with my staff only I crossed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.\n32:11 Deliver me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and attack me, even the mother with the children.\n32:12  But You have said, I will surely do you good and make your seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.\n32:13 And he spent that night there. Then from what he had with him he took a present for Esau his brother:\n32:14 Two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,\n32:15 Thirty nursing camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.\n32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, Cross over before me, and put a space between each drove.\n32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, To whom do you belong? And where are you going? And whose animals are these before you?\n32:18 Then you will say, Your servant Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau; and now he also is behind us.\n32:19 And he commanded also the second and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this way you shall speak to Esau when you find him,\n32:20 And you shall also say, Your servant Jacob is right behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.\n32:21 So the present crossed over before him, and he himself spent that night in the camp.\n32:22 And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two female servants and his eleven children and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.\n32:23 And he took them and sent them over the stream and sent over what he had.\n32:24 And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.\n32:25  And when the man saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with Him.\n32:26 And the man said, Let Me go, for the dawn is breaking. But Jacob said, I will not let You go unless You bless me.\n32:27 And He said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.\n32:28 And He said, Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.\n32:29 And Jacob asked Him and said, Please tell me Your name. But He said, Why is it that you ask My name? And He blessed him there.\n32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, for, he said, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has been preserved.\n32:31 And the sun rose upon him as he crossed over Penuel, and he limped because of his hip.\n32:32 Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the thigh muscle, which is upon the socket of the hip, to this day, because He touched the socket of Jacob's hip at the thigh muscle.\n\nGenesis 33\n\n33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and there was Esau coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and among Rachel and among the two female servants.\n33:2 And he put the female servants and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.\n33:3 And he himself passed on before them and bowed down to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.\n33:4 And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.\n33:5  And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your servant.\n33:6 Then the female servants came near, they and their children, and they bowed down.\n33:7 And Leah also came near with her children, and they bowed down; and afterward Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed down.\n33:8 And Esau said, What do you mean by all this camp which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.\n33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let what you have be yours.\n33:10 And Jacob said, No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then take my present from my hand; for I see your face as one sees the face of God, and you have received me favorably.\n33:11 Please take my blessing which has been brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have all that I need. So he urged him, and he took it.\n33:12 Then Esau said, Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before you.\n33:13 And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are frail and that the nursing flocks and herds are a concern to me; and if they overdrive them for one day, all the flock will die.\n33:14 Let my lord please pass on before his servant, and I will lead on slowly according to the pace of the cattle which are before me and according to the pace of the children until I come to my lord at Seir.\n33:15 So Esau said, Let me please leave with you some of the people who are with me. And he said, What need is there? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.\n33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.\n33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built a house for himself and made booths for his livestock; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.\n33:18  And Jacob came safely to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddanaram; and he camped before the city.\n33:19 And he bought the piece of land where he had pitched his tent from the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred qesitahs.\n33:20 And there he erected an altar and called it ElEloheIsrael.\n\nGenesis 34\n\n34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.\n34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her and humbled her.\n34:3 And his soul clung to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke affectionately to the girl.\n34:4 And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor, saying, Get me this young girl as a wife.\n34:5 Now when Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, his sons were with his livestock in the field; so Jacob kept silent until they came in.\n34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to speak with him.\n34:7 And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard of it. And the men were grieved and became very angry, because he had committed folly in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, for such a thing ought not to be done.\n34:8 And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter; please give her to him as a wife.\n34:9 And make marriages with us: Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.\n34:10  And you shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you; dwell and trade in it, and acquire holdings in it.\n34:11 And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, Let me find favor in your sight, and whatever you say to me I will give.\n34:12 Impose upon me a very large bridal price and gift, and I will give whatever you say to me; but give me the girl as a wife.\n34:13 Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully; and because he had defiled Dinah their sister they spoke,\n34:14 And said to them, We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a reproach to us.\n34:15 Only on this condition will we consent to you: If you become like us, and every male among you is circumcised,\n34:16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and will take your daughters for ourselves; and we will dwell with you and become one people.\n34:17 But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.\n34:18 And their words seemed good to Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.\n34:19 And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter. Now he was honored above all the house of his father.\n34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city and spoke with the men of their city, saying,\n34:21 These men are with us peacefully; therefore let them dwell in the land and trade in it, for here the land is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters for ourselves as wives, and let us give them our daughters.\n34:22 Only on this condition will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to become one people: that every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.\n34:23 Will not their livestock and their property and all their animals be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.\n34:24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.\n34:25 Then on the third day, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares, and slew every male.\n34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and they took Dinah out of Shechem's house and went away.\n34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.\n34:28 They took their flocks and their herds and their donkeys and whatever was in the city and whatever was in the field;\n34:29 And they took captive and plundered all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, and even all that was in the houses.\n34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have brought trouble upon me by making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I am few in number, and they will gather themselves together against me and strike me; and I will be destroyed, I and my house.\n34:31 And they said, Should he treat our sister like a harlot?\n\nGenesis 35\n\n35:1 And God said to Jacob, Rise up, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.\n35:2 Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments.\n35:3 And let us rise up and go up to Bethel, that I may make an altar there to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with m"));

Joseph, when he was seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers while he was still a youth, with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.\n37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he had made him a coat of many colors.\n37:4 And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.\n37:5 Then Joseph had a dream; and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.\n37:6 And he said to them, Listen to this dream which I have had:\n37:7 There we were, binding sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf rose up and remained standing; and then your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.\n37:8 And his brothers said to him, Will you indeed reign over us and actually be a ruler among us? So they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.\n37:9 And he had still another dream and told it to his brothers and said, Now I have had another dream: There were the sun and the moon and eleven stars, bowing down to me.\n37:10 And he told it to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, What is this dream that you have had? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down to the ground to you?\n37:11 And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in his heart.\n37:12 Then his brothers went to shepherd their father's flock in Shechem.\n37:13  And Israel said to Joseph, Your brothers are now shepherding the flock in Shechem. Come, and I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here I am.\n37:14 And he said to him, Go now, see if it is well with your brothers and well with the flock, and bring word back to me. So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.\n37:15 And a man found him; and there he was, wandering in the field, and the man asked him, saying, What are you seeking?\n37:16 And he said, I am seeking my brothers. Please tell me where they are shepherding the flock.\n37:17 And the man said, They have moved on from here; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers and found them in Dothan.\n37:18 And when they saw him from a distance and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to put him to death.\n37:19 And they said one to another, Here comes this master of dreams.\n37:20 Now then, come and let us slay him and throw him into one of the pits; and we will say, A wild beast has devoured him; then we will see what will become of his dreams.\n37:21 But when Reuben heard it, he tried to deliver him out of their hand and said, Let us not take his life.\n37:22 And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood; throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on himthat he might deliver him out of their hand to restore him to his father.\n37:23 And when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;\n37:24 And they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty; there was no water in it.\n37:25 Then they sat down to eat food; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and there was a caravan of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.\n37:26  Then Judah said to his brothers, What gain is there if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?\n37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let our hand not be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers listened to him.\n37:28 So when some Midianite traders passed by, they pulled Joseph up, lifting him out of the pit, and they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And these brought Joseph into Egypt.\n37:29 And when Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he tore his clothes.\n37:30 And he returned to his brothers and said, The boy is not there; so as for me, what shall I do?\n37:31 Then they took Joseph's coat and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the coat in the blood.\n37:32 And they sent the coat of many colors and had it brought to their father and said, We found this; please examine it, and see if it is your son's coat or not.\n37:33 And he recognized it and said, It is my son's coat. A wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces.\n37:34 And Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days.\n37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted and said, Surely I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning. Thus his father wept for him.\n37:36 Meanwhile the Midianites had sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.\n\nGenesis 38\n\n38:1 Now at that time Judah went down from his brothers and pitched his tent near a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.\n38:2  And Judah saw there the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her and went in to her.\n38:3 And she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.\n38:4 And she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.\n38:5 And yet again she bore a son and called his name Shelah, and she was in Chezib when she bore him.\n38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.\n38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah put him to death.\n38:8 And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a brotherinlaw to her, and raise up seed to your brother.\n38:9 But since Onan knew that the seed would not be his, whenever he went in to his brother's wife, he spilled it on the ground, so that he would not give seed to his brother.\n38:10 But what he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, so He put him to death also.\n38:11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughterinlaw, Remain a widow in your father's house until Shelah my son grows up. For he thought, He also may die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.\n38:12 And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted and went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.\n38:13 And it was told to Tamar, saying, Your fatherinlaw is now going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.\n38:14 And she removed from herself her widow's garments and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as his wife.\n38:15 And when Judah saw her, he thought she was a harlot, for she had covered her face.\n38:16  And he turned aside to her by the way and said, "));

And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?\n38:17 And he said, I will send you a kid from the flock. And she said, Only if you give me a pledge until you send it.\n38:18 And he said, What pledge shall I give you? And she said, Your seal and your cord and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her and went in to her, and she conceived by him.\n38:19 And she arose and went away, and removed her veil from herself and put on her widow's garments.\n38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand; but he did not find her.\n38:21 Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute who was by the road at Enaim? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.\n38:22 And he returned to Judah and said, I did not find her; and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.\n38:23 And Judah said, Let her keep the things for herself, lest we become a laughing stock; you see, I sent her this kid, but you did not find her.\n38:24 And about three months later it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughterinlaw has played the harlot; moreover, now she is pregnant by harlotry. And Judah said, Bring her out, and let her be burned.\n38:25 As she was being brought out, she sent word to her fatherinlaw, saying, I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong. And she said, Please note whose these are, the seal and the cords and the staff.\n38:26 And Judah took note of them and said, She is more righteous than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah. And he did not know her again anymore.\n38:27 And at the time of her delivery, there were twins in her womb.\n38:28 And while she was giving birth, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and tied on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This one came out first.\n38:29 But when he drew back his hand, his brother suddenly came out; and she said, What a breach you have made for yourself! Therefore his name was called Perez.\n38:30 And afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand; and his name was called Zerah.\n\nGenesis 39\n\n39:1 Now Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an official of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there.\n39:2 And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he became a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.\n39:3 And his master saw that Jehovah was with him and that Jehovah caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n39:4 And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered to him; and he made him overseer of his house and put all that he hadin his charge.\n39:5 And from the time he made him overseer in his house and put him over all that he had, Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house on account of Joseph; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.\n39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's charge; and with him there, he was not concerned about anything except the food that he ate. And Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.\n39:7 Now after these things his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, Lie with me.\n39:8 But he refused and said to his master's wife, Behold, with me here, my master is not concerned about anything in the house, and he has put everything he has in my charge.\n39:9 There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil, and sin against God?\n39:10 And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her to lie beside her or be with her.\n39:11 And one such day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the men of the house were there in the house.\n39:12 And she grabbed him by his garment, saying, Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and went outside.\n39:13 And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,\n39:14 She called to the men of her house and spoke to them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew man to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I called out with a loud voice;\n39:15 And when he heard that I lifted up my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me, and fled and went outside.\n39:16 And she placed his garment beside her until his master came home.\n39:17 And she spoke to him with these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me.\n39:18 And when I lifted up my voice and called out, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.\n39:19 And when his master heard the words of his wife that she had spoken to him, saying, This is the way your servant treated me; his anger burned.\n39:20 And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But while he was there in the prison,\n39:21 Jehovah was with Joseph; and He extended kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.\n39:22  And the chief jailer put in Joseph's charge all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the one to do it.\n39:23 The chief jailer did not supervise anything that was in his charge, because Jehovah was with him; and whatever he did, Jehovah caused it to prosper.\n\nGenesis 40\n\n40:1 And after these things, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt.\n40:2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief of the cupbearers and the chief of the bakers.\n40:3 And he put them in custody at the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison, the place where Joseph was confined.\n40:4 And the captain of the guard put Joseph in charge of them, and he ministered to them; and they were in custody for some time.\n40:5 And the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, both of them had a dream, each man with his own dream in one night, and each dream with its own interpretation.\n40:6 And Joseph came to them in the morning and looked at them, and they were troubled.\n40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officials, who were with him in custody in his master's house, saying, Why are your faces so sad today?\n40:8 And they said to him, We have had a dream, and there is no one to interpret it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.\n40:9 And the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph and said to him, In my dream there was a vine before me,\n40:10  And on the vine were three branches. And as soon as it budded, its blossoms came out, and its clusters ripened into grapes.\n40:11 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I put the cup in Pharaoh's hand.\n40:12 And Joseph said to him, This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days.\n40:13 Within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office, and you will put Pharaoh's cup into his hand according to your former custom when you were his cupbearer.\n40:14 But remember my being with you when it is well with you, and please do me a kindness and make mention of me to Pharaoh and so have me brought out of this house.\n40:15 For I was actually kidnapped out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have not done anything that they should put me into the dungeon.\n40:16 Now when the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also saw this in my dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head.\n40:17 And in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.\n40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.\n40:19 Within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and will hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.\n40:20 And on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers among his servants.\n40:21 And he restored the chief of the cupbearers to his cupbearing, and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand;\n40:22 But the chief of the bakers he hanged, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.\n40:23  Yet the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.\n\nGenesis 41\n\n41:1 And at the end of two full years Pharaoh had a dream, and there he was, standing by the River.\n41:2 And there came up out of the River seven cows, fine looking and fat fleshed; and they grazed in the reed grass.\n41:3 Then there came up after them seven other cows out of the River, ugly looking and thin fleshed; and they stood beside the other cows on the bank of the River.\n41:4 And the ugly looking and thin fleshed cows ate up the seven fine looking and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.\n41:5 And he slept and dreamed a second time. And there were seven ears of grain, coming up on one stalk, fat and good.\n41:6 Then there were seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, that sprouted after them.\n41:7 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream.\n41:8 And in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all her wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.\n41:9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my sins today.\n41:10 Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me in custody at the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker.\n41:11 And we both had a dream in one night, I and he; each of us had a dream with its own interpretation.\n41:12  And a young Hebrew man was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. And we told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us; to each one he interpreted according to his dream.\n41:13 And as he interpreted to us, so it happened; Pharaoh restored me to my office, and he hanged the baker.\n41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he had shaved himself and changed his garments, and he came to Pharaoh.\n41:15 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have had a dream, but there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.\n41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not of me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.\n41:17 And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, there I was, standing on the bank of the River.\n41:18 And there came up out of the River seven cows, fat fleshed and fine looking; and they grazed in the reed grass.\n41:19 Then there came up after them seven other cows, poor and very ugly looking and thin fleshed; I had never seen such in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.\n41:20 And the thin and ugly looking cows ate up the first seven fat cows.\n41:21 And when they had swallowed them, no one would have known that they had swallowed them, for they were still as ugly looking as at the beginning. Then I awoke.\n41:22 And I saw this in my next dream: There were seven ears of grain, coming up on one stalk, full and good.\n41:23 Then there were seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, that sprouted after them.\n41:24 And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.\n41:25  Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, Pharaoh's dream is one dream; what God is about to do He has told Pharaoh.\n41:26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.\n41:27 And the seven thin and ugly looking cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven empty ears scorched by the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.\n41:28 This matter is just as I have spoken to Pharaoh; what God is about to do He has shown to Pharaoh.\n41:29 Seven years of great abundance are now about to come throughout all the land of Egypt.\n41:30 Then seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will consume the land.\n41:31 And the abundance will be unknown in the land because of that famine which follows, for it will be very severe.\n41:32 And as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it means that the matter is determined by God, and God will quickly bring it about.\n41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out for a discerning and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.\n41:34 Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.\n41:35 And let them gather all the food of these coming good years and lay up grain under Pharaoh's authority for food in the cities, and let them keep it.\n41:36 And let the food become a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine that will be in the land of Egypt, so that the land does not perish in the famine.\n41:37 And the word seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.\n41:38  And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a man like this, in whom the Spirit of God is?\n41:39 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God let you know all this, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.\n41:40 You shall be over my household, and according to your word all my people shall be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than you.\n41:41 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.\n41:42 And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck.\n41:43 And he made him ride in the chariot of his secondincommand, and they cried out before him, Bow the knee! And he set him over all the land of Egypt.\n41:44 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, yet without your consent no man will lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.\n41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenathpaneah, and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, as his wife. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.\n41:46 Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and passed through all the land of Egypt.\n41:47 And in the seven years of abundance the earth produced copiously.\n41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which came upon the land of Egypt and put"));

And there was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.\n41:55 So when all the land of Egypt became hungry, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; whatever he says to you, you shall do.\n41:56 And when the famine was over all the face of the earth, Joseph opened all the storehouses of grain and sold grain to the Egyptians; and the famine became severe in the land of Egypt.\n41:57 And all the earth came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.\n\nGenesis 42\n\n42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, Jacob said to his sons, Why do you keep looking at one another?\n42:2 And he said, I have now heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there, and buy grain for us from there, that we may live and not die.\n42:3 So Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.\n42:4 But Jacob did not send Joseph's brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, Perhaps harm may befall him.\n42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy grain among those who also came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n42:6  Now Joseph was the governor over the land; it was he who sold grain to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.\n42:7 And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he disguised himself to them and spoke harshly with them. And he said to them, Where have you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy grain for food.\n42:8 And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.\n42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, and he said to them, You are spies; you have come to see the nakedness of the land.\n42:10 And they said to him, No, my lord; rather your servants have come to buy grain for food.\n42:11 We are all sons of one man. We are honest men; your servants have never been spies.\n42:12 And he said to them, No; but you have come to see the nakedness of the land.\n42:13 And they said, We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and at this moment the youngest is with our father today, and one is no more.\n42:14 But Joseph said to them, It is just as I spoke to you, saying, You are spies.\n42:15 By this you shall be tested: As Pharaoh lives, you shall not go away from this place unless your youngest brother comes here.\n42:16 Send one of you to get your brother, while you remain bound, that your words may be tested whether there is truth in you. And if not, as Pharaoh lives, surely you are spies.\n42:17 And he put them all together in custody three days.\n42:18 And Joseph said to them on the third day, Do this and live, for I fear God.\n42:19 If you are honest men, let one of your brothers remain bound in your place of custody; and the rest of you go, carry grain for the famine of your households.\n42:20  And bring your youngest brother to me, that your words may be verified; and you will not die. And they did so.\n42:21 And they said one to another, We are indeed guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, yet we would not listen; therefore this distress has come to us.\n42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Do not sin against the child? But you would not listen. So now also his blood is required.\n42:23 And they did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between them.\n42:24 And he turned away from them and wept. Then he returned to them and spoke to them. And he took Simeon from among them and bound him before their eyes.\n42:25 Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain and to restore every man's silver pieces into his sack and to give them provisions for the way. And thus was it done for them.\n42:26 And they loaded their grain upon their donkeys and departed from there.\n42:27 And one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the lodging place, and he saw his silver; there it was in the mouth of his sack.\n42:28 And he said to his brothers, My silver has been returned; and here it is in my sack! And their heart stopped, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?\n42:29 And they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan and told him all that had happened to them, saying,\n42:30 The man, the lord of the land, spoke harshly to us and took us for spies on the land.\n42:31 But we said to him, We are honest men; we have never been spies.\n42:32 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; the one is no more, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.\n42:33  And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this will I know that you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for the famine of your households, and go.\n42:34 And bring your youngest brother to me that I may know that you are not spies but are honest men. I will give you your brother, and you may trade in the land.\n42:35 And when they emptied their sacks, there was each man's bundle of silver pieces, in his sack. And when they and their father saw their bundles of silver, they were afraid.\n42:36 And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin; all these things are against me.\n42:37 And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, You may put to death my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Put him in my hand, and I will return him to you.\n42:38 But he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. And if harm should befall him on the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.\n\nGenesis 43\n\n43:1 Now the famine was severe in the land.\n43:2 And when they had completely consumed the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go back; buy us a little food.\n43:3 But Judah spoke to him, saying, The man solemnly warned us, saying, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.\n43:4 If you are willing to send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you grain for food;\n43:5 But if you are not willing to send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.\n43:6 And Israel said, Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had another brother?\n43:7  And they said, The man asked very carefully about us and about our relatives, saying, Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother? So we told him about these things. Could we possibly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?\n43:8 And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the boy with me, and we will rise up and go, that we may live and not die, we and you and our little ones.\n43:9 I myself will be surety for him; of my hand you may require him. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, then I shall bear the blame of sinning before you forever.\n43:10 For if we had not delayed, by now we could have returned twice.\n43:11 And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so, then do this: Take some of the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry a present down to the mana little balm and a little honey, aromatic gum and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.\n43:12 And take double the silver in your hand, and carry back in your hand the silver that was returned in the mouth of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.\n43:13 Take your brother also, and rise up. Return to the man,\n43:14 And may the Allsufficient God grant you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am to be bereaved of my children, I shall be bereaved.\n43:15 So the men took this present, and they took double the silver in their hand and Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.\n43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to him who was over his house, Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal, and prepare it; for the men will eat with me at noon.\n43:17 And the man did as Joseph said, and the man brought the men into Joseph's house.\n43:18 And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, It is because of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, that we are being brought in, that he may come out against us and fall upon us and take us as slaves with our donkeys.\n43:19 And they came near to the man who was over Joseph's house and spoke to him at the door of the house,\n43:20 And said, Please, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy grain for food;\n43:21 And when we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and there was each man's silver, in the mouth of his sack, our silver in full weight. So we have brought it back in our hand.\n43:22 And we have also brought down extra silver in our hand to buy grain for food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.\n43:23 And he said, Be at peace; do not fear. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me. Then he brought Simeon out to them.\n43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys fodder.\n43:25 And they prepared the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they had heard that they would eat a meal there.\n43:26 And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed down to the ground to him.\n43:27 And he asked them about their welfare and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?\n43:28 And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is still alive. And they bowed and paid him homage.\n43:29 And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.\n43:30 And Joseph hurriedfor his inward parts burned for his brotherand sought a place to weep. So he entered into his chamber and wept there.\n43:31 Then he washed his face and came out, and he controlled himself and said, Serve the meal.\n43:32 And they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat a meal with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.\n43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.\n43:34 And he had portions brought to them from before him; however Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank and were merry with him.\n\nGenesis 44\n\n44:1 And he commanded him who was over his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack.\n44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest with his silver for the grain. And he did so, according to the word that Joseph had spoken.\n44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.\n44:4 When they had just gone out of the city and were not yet far off, Joseph said to him who was over his house, Rise up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you repaid evil for good?\n44:5 Is not this that from which my lord drinks, and which he indeed uses for divining? You have done wrong in so doing.\n44:6 And he overtook them and spoke these words to them.\n44:7 And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing.\n44:8 See how we brought back to you the silver which we found in the mouth of our sacks from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold out of your lord's house?\n44:9  With whomever of your servants it is found, let him die; and we ourselves will become my lord's slaves.\n44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: He with whom it is found will be my slave; and the rest of you will be blameless.\n44:11 Then each man hurried and lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack.\n44:12 And he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n44:13 Then they tore their garments, and each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.\n44:14 And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him.\n44:15 And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?\n44:16 And Judah said, What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Here we are, my lord's slaves, both we and the one in whose hand the cup has been found.\n44:17 But he said, Far be it from me to do this. The man in whose hand the cup has been found, he will be my slave; but as for the rest of you, go up in peace to your father.\n44:18 Then Judah came near to him and said, Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.\n44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Do you have a father or a brother?\n44:20 And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.\n44:21 And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.\n44:22  And we said to my lord, The boy cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.\n44:23 And you said to your servants, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall see my face no more.\n44:24"));

So there was no one standing with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.\n45:2 And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard it.\n45:3 And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph! Is my father still alive? But his brothers could not answer him, so troubled were they at his presence.\n45:4 And Joseph said to his brothers, Please come closer to me. And they came closer. And he said, I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.\n45:5 And now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.\n45:6 For the famine has been in the midst of the land these two years, and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.\n45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.\n45:8 So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.\n45:9 Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me; do not delay.\n45:10 And you shall dwell in the land of Goshen and be near to me, you and your children and your children's children and your flocks and your herds and all that you have.\n45:11 And there I will sustain youfor there are still five years of famine to comeso that you and your household and all that you have do not become impoverished.\n45:12  And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that it is my own mouth that speaks to you.\n45:13 And you must tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that you have seen, and you must hurry and bring my father down here.\n45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.\n45:15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them, and after that his brothers talked with him.\n45:16 And when the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come, it was pleasing to Pharaoh and to his servants.\n45:17 And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, Do this: Load your beasts, and depart; go to the land of Canaan;\n45:18 And take your father and your households, and come to me; and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.\n45:19 And you are commanded, Do this: Take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives; and bring your father, and come.\n45:20 And do not be concerned for your possessions, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.\n45:21 And the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh and gave them provisions for the way.\n45:22 To each of them he gave changes of garments; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.\n45:23 And he sent to his father the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father on the way.\n45:24 So he sent his brothers away; and as they departed, he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way.\n45:25 So they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.\n45:26  And they told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart became numb, for he did not believe them.\n45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived.\n45:28 And Israel said, It is enough.

And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.\n46:13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola and Puvah and Iob and Shimron.\n46:14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered and Elon and Jahleel.\n46:15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddanaram, along with his daughter Dinah. His sons and his daughters were thirtythree persons in all.\n46:16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion and Haggi, Shuni and Ezbon, Eri and Arodi and Areli.\n46:17 And the sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.\n46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah; and she bore these to Jacob, sixteen persons.\n46:19 The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.\n46:20 And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bore to him.\n46:21 And the sons of Benjamin: Bela and Becher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ehi and Rosh, Muppim and Huppim and Ard.\n46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob, fourteen persons in all.\n46:23 And the sons of Dan: Hushim.\n46:24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and Shillem.\n46:25  These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter, and she bore these to Jacob, seven persons in all.\n46:26 All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his loins, besides the wives of Jacob's sons, were sixtysix persons in all.\n46:27 And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy.\n46:28 And he sent Judah before him to Joseph to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came to the land of Goshen.\n46:29 And Joseph made his chariot ready and went up to Goshen to meet Israel his father. And when he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.\n46:30 And Israel said to Joseph, Let me die now since I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.\n46:31 And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and will say to him, My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.\n46:32 And the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.\n46:33 And when Pharaoh calls you and says, What is your occupation?\n46:34 You shall say, Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers; that you may dwell in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.\n\nGenesis 47\n\n47:1 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh and said, My father and my brothers and their flocks and their herds and all that they have, have come out of the land of Canaan; and now they are in the land of Goshen.\n47:2 And he took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.\n47:3 And Pharaoh said to his brothers, What is your occupation? And they said to Pharaoh, Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers.\n47:4 And they said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land because there is no pasture for your servants' flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.\n47:5 And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, Your father and your brothers have come to you.\n47:6 The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land; let them dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know any capable men among them, make them overseers over my livestock.\n47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.\n47:8 And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the years of your life?\n47:9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The years of my sojourning are one hundred thirty years; few and evil have been the years of my life, and they have not attained to the years of the lives of my fathers during the days of their sojourning.\n47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went forth from Pharaoh's presence.\n47:11 And Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.\n47:12 And Joseph sustained his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food according to the number of their little ones.\n47:13 And there was no food in all the land, for the famine was so very severe that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished because of the famine.\n47:14 And Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.\n47:15 And when the money from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan had been spent, all the Egyptians came to Joseph saying, Give us food, for why should we die in your presence? For our money is gone.\n47:16 And Joseph said, Bring your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.\n47:17 And they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses and for the flocks of sheep and for the herds of cattle and for the donkeys; and he fed them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year.\n47:18 And when that year had ended, they came to him the second year and said to him, We cannot hide from my lord that our money has been spent, and the herds of cattle are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord except our bodies and our lands.\n47:19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.\n47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's.\n47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end.\n47:22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh, and they lived off their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.\n47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, Now that I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh, here is seed for you that you may sow the land.\n47:24 And when harvest comes, you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and fourfifths shall be your own as seed of the field and as food for you and for those of your households and as food for your little ones.\n47:25  And they said, You have saved our lives. May we find favor in the sight of my lord and be Pharaoh's servants.\n47:26 And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt that stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.\n47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they acquired possessions in it and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.\n47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. Thus the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred fortyseven years.\n47:29 And the time for Israel to die drew near. And he called his son Joseph and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and deal with me in kindness and truth; please do not bury me in Egypt.\n47:30 But when I lie down with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said.\n47:31 And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself at the head of his bed.\n\nGenesis 48\n\n48:1 Now after these things Joseph was told, Your father is now sick.

And he said, Bring them to me, that I may bless them.\n48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, and he could not see. So Joseph brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.\n48:11 And Israel said to Joseph, I never expected to see your face, and now God has let me see your seed also.\n48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees and bowed himself with his face to the ground.\n48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.\n48:14 But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim's headalthough he was the youngerand his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands with insight, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.\n48:15 And he blessed Joseph and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day,\n48:16  The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; And may my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; And may they be a teeming multitude in the midst of the earth.\n48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head onto Manasseh's head.\n48:18 And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand upon his head.\n48:19 But his father refused and said, I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will become greater than he, and his seed will become a multitude of nations.\n48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, By you Israel will bless, saying, God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh. Thus he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n48:21 And Israel said to Joseph, Now I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.\n48:22 Moreover I have given to you one portion more than your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.\n\nGenesis 49\n\n49:1 And Jacob called to his sons and said, Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the last days.\n49:2 Assemble yourselves, and listen, O sons of Jacob; Yes, listen to Israel your father.\n49:3 Reuben, you are my firstborn, My might and the beginning of my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.\n49:4 Boiling over like water, you will not have the preeminence, Because you went up to your father's bed; Then you defiled ithe went up to my couch.\n49:5 Simeon and Levi are brothers; Weapons of violence are their swords.\n49:6 Come not into their council, O my soul; Be not united with their assembly, O my glory; For in their anger they slew men, And in their selfwill they hamstrung oxen.\n49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; And their wrath, for it is cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.\n49:8 Judah, your brothers will praise you; Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons will bow down before you.\n49:9 Judah is a young lion; From the prey, my son, you have gone up.

Now therefore please let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.\n50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.\n50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father; and all the servants of Pharaoh went up with him, the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of Egypt,\n50:8 And all the house of Joseph and his brothers and his father's household; they left only their little ones and their flocks and their herds in the land of Goshen.\n50:9 And chariots also went up with him, as well as horsemen; and it was a very great company.\n50:10 And they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation; and he observed seven days of mourning for his father.\n50:11  And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians. Therefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.\n50:12 And thus his sons did to him as he commanded them;\n50:13 And his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre, which Abraham had bought with the field for a possession of a burial place from Ephron the Hittite.\n50:14 And after he had buried his father, Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brothers and all who went up with him to bury his father.\n50:15 And when Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, What if Joseph bears a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the evil which we did to him?\n50:16 And they sent a message to Joseph, saying, Your father charged before he died, saying,\n50:17 Thus shall you say to Joseph, Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong. So now please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father. And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.\n50:18 And his brothers also went and fell down before him and said, We are here as your servants.\n50:19 And Joseph said to them, Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?\n50:20 Even though you intended evil against me, God intended it for good, to do as it is this day, to preserve alive a numerous people.\n50:21 Now therefore do not be afraid; I will sustain you and your little ones. And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.\n50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's household; and Joseph lived one hundred ten years.\n50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation; the children of Machir the son of Manasseh were also born on Joseph's knees.\n50:24 And Joseph said to his brothers, I am about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.\n50:25 And Joseph made the children of Israel swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall bring my bones up from here.\n50:26 And Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."));

Exodus\n\nExodus 1\n\n1:1 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each man came with his household:\n1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,\n1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,\n1:4 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.\n1:5 And all the persons who came forth from the loins of Jacob were seventy persons, but Joseph was already in Egypt.\n1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.\n1:7 But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, and the land was filled with them.\n1:8 And a new king rose up over Egypt, who did not know of Joseph.\n1:9 And he said to his people, The people of the children of Israel are now more numerous and stronger than we.\n1:10 Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and, when some war occurs, they also join themselves to those who hate us and fight against us and go up from the land.\n1:11 So they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built storage cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.\n1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out so that they came to dread the children of Israel.\n1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with harshness,\n1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of labor in the field; all their labor with which they made them serve was with harshness.\n1:15 And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one whose name was Shiphrah and the other whose name was Puah;\n1:16 And he said, When you act as midwives for the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, then you shall put him to death; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.\n1:17 But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them but let the male children live.\n1:18 So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing and let the male children live?\n1:19 And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous: before the midwife comes to them, they give birth.\n1:20 And God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very strong.\n1:21 And because the midwives feared God, He established households for them.\n1:22 And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, Every son who is born you shall cast into the River, but every daughter you shall let live. /n/nExodus 2/n\n2:1 And a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as wife.\n2:2 And the woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months.\n2:3 And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him a papyrus basket and plastered it with tar and pitch; and she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the bank of the River.\n2:4  And his sister stood at a distance to find out what would happen to him.\n2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the River while her maidens walked alongside the River. And she saw the basket in the midst of the reeds and sent her female servant, and she brought it to her.\n2:6 And she opened it and saw the child, and there was the boy, weeping. And she had compassion on him and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.\n2:7 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse from the Hebrew women for you that she may nurse the child for you?\n2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the child's mother.\n2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages. So the woman took the child and nursed him.\n2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses and said, Because I drew him out of the water.\n2:11 And in those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his brothers and looked on their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brothers.\n2:12 And he looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one there, he struck the Egyptian down and hid him in the sand.\n2:13 And he went out the next day, and there were two Hebrew men struggling together; and he said to the one who was in the wrong, Why are you beating your companion?\n2:14 And he said, Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us? Are you thinking to kill me as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses became frightened and said, Surely the matter is known.\n2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard of this matter, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh to dwell in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.\n2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.\n2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses rose up and helped them and watered their flock.\n2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why have you come back so quickly today?\n2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and he even drew water for us as well and watered the flock.\n2:20 And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why did you leave the man? Invite him to eat a meal.\n2:21 And Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.\n2:22 And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.\n2:23 And in the course of those many days the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage. And they cried out, and their cry went up to God because of their bondage.\n2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.\n2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God took notice of them. /n/nExodus 3/n\n3:1 Now Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his fatherinlaw, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.\n3:2 And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thornbush. And when he looked, there was the thornbush, burning with fire; but the thornbush was not consumed.\n3:3  And Moses said, I must turn aside now and see this great sight, why the thornbush does not burn up.\n3:4 And when Jehovah saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the midst of the thornbush and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am.\n3:5 And He said, Do not come near here. Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground.\n3:6 And He said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.\n3:7 And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.\n3:8 And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.\n3:9 And now the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.\n3:10 So come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.\n3:11 But Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n3:12 And He said, Surely I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will serve God upon this mountain.\n3:13 Then Moses said to God, If I come to the children of Israel and say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they say to me, What is His name? what shall I say to them?\n3:14 And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you\n3:15 And God also said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial from generation to generation.\n3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you and seen what is being done to you in Egypt.\n3:17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.\n3:18 And they will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; and now let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.\n3:19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, not even when compelled by a mighty hand.\n3:20 So I will stretch out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will perform in the midst of it, and after that he will let you go.\n3:21 And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that when you go, you will not go emptyhanded.\n3:22 But every woman will ask of her neighbor and of any woman living in her house for articles of silver and articles of gold and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and on your daughters, and thus plunder the Egyptians. /n/nExodus 4/n\n4:1 Then Moses answered and said, What if they do not believe me or listen to my voice, but say, Jehovah has not appeared to you?\n4:2 And Jehovah said to him, What is this in your hand? And he said, A staff.\n4:3  And He said, Throw it on the ground. And he threw it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses recoiled from it.\n4:4 And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand, and take it by its tailso he stretched out his hand and seized it, and it became a staff in his hand\n4:5 That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.\n4:6 And Jehovah further said to him, Now put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, there his hand was, leprous like snow.\n4:7 And He said, Put your hand into your bosom againso he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, there it was, restored like the rest of his flesh\n4:8 And if they do not believe you or heed the first sign, then they may believe the next sign.\n4:9 And if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice, then you shall take some of the water of the River and pour it on the dry ground, and the water that you take out of the River will become blood upon the dry ground.\n4:10 And Moses said to Jehovah, Please, Lord, I am not a man of words, neither in the past, nor since You have spoken to Your servant, for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.\n4:11 And Jehovah said to him, Who gave man a mouth? Or who makes him dumb or deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?\n4:12 Now go therefore, and I will be with your mouth and will teach you what you shall speak.\n4:13 And he said, Please, Lord, send word through someone else whom You will send.\n4:14 And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and He said, Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he can certainly speak. And even now he is coming out to meet you; and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.\n4:15 And you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you what you shall do.\n4:16 And he shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be as a mouth for you, and you shall be as God to him.\n4:17 And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs.\n4:18 And Moses went back to Jethro his fatherinlaw. And he said to him, Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.\n4:19 And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who were seeking your life have died.\n4:20 So Moses took his wife and his sons, and mounted them upon a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.\n4:21 And Jehovah said to Moses, When you go to return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your power; but I will harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.\n4:22 Then you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah, Israel is My son, My firstborn.\n4:23 And I said to you, Let My son go that he may serve Me; but you have refused to let him go. I will now slay your son, your firstborn.\n4:24 And at the lodging place on the way, Jehovah came upon him and sought to put him to death.\n4:25 Then Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son's foreskin and cast it at Moses' feet, and she said, You are indeed a bridegroom of blood to me!\n4:26 So He let him alone. It was then that she said, A bridegroom of blood, because of the circumcision.\n4:27 And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went and came upon him at the mountain of God, and he kissed him.\n4:28  And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah with which He had sent him and all the signs with which He had charged him.\n4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.\n4:30 And Aaron spoke all the words which Jehovah had spoken to Moses, and he performed the signs in the sight of the people.\n4:31 And the people believed; and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel and that He had seen their affliction, they bowed and worshipped. /n/nExodus 5/n\n5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.\n5:2 But Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah that I should listen to His voice to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, and I also will not let Israel go.\n5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God; otherwise He will fall upon us with pestilence or sword.\n5:4 Then the king of Egypt said to them, Moses and Aaron, why are you"));

Get back to your burdens.\n5:5 And Pharaoh said, Look, the people of the land are now many, yet you want them to cease from their burdens.\n5:6 And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,\n5:7 You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks as previously; let them go and gather straw for themselves.\n5:8  And the quota of the bricks which they made previously, you shall still place upon them; you shall not diminish any of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry out, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.\n5:9 Let the work be laid more heavily upon such men, so that they do it and not pay attention to false words.\n5:10 And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.\n5:11 You go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, for none of your work will be reduced.\n5:12 So the people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.\n5:13 And the taskmasters pressed them saying, Finish your work, the same daily assignment as when there was straw.\n5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and told, Why have you not finished, both yesterday and today, the amount of bricks required of you previously?\n5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, Why do you treat your servants this way?\n5:16 No straw is given to your servants, and they say to us, Make bricks. And now your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of your own people.\n5:17 But he said, Idle is what you are, idle; therefore you say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.\n5:18 So go now and work; and no straw shall be given you, but you shall deliver the quota of bricks.\n5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, You shall not diminish any of the daily assignment of your bricks.\n5:20 And they came upon Moses and Aaron who were standing there to meet them when they came forth from Pharaoh.\n5:21  And they said to them, Jehovah look upon you and judge, because you have made us odious in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants so as to put a sword in their hand to kill us.\n5:22 Then Moses went back to Jehovah and said, Lord, why have You mistreated this people? Why is it that You sent me?\n5:23 Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has mistreated this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all. /n/nExodus 6/n\n6:1 And Jehovah said to Moses, Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh; for because of a mighty hand he will let them go, and because of a mighty hand he will drive them out of his land.\n6:2 And God spoke to Moses and said to him, I am Jehovah.\n6:3 And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as the Allsufficient God; but by My name Jehovah I did not make Myself known to them.\n6:4 And I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, in which they sojourned.\n6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved; and I have remembered My covenant.\n6:6 Therefore say to the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.\n6:7 And I will take you to Myself as My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God, the One who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.\n6:8 And I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you as a possession. I am Jehovah.\n6:9  And Moses spoke this to the children of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses on account of exasperation of spirit and harsh bondage.\n6:10 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n6:11 Go, speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.\n6:12 And Moses spoke before Jehovah, saying, The children of Israel do not now listen to me. How then will Pharaoh listen to me, since I am of uncircumcised lips?\n6:13 And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron and gave them a charge for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.\n6:14 These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.\n6:15 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.\n6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon and Kohath and Merari; and the years of Levi's life were one hundred thirty seven years.\n6:17 The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.\n6:18 And the sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel; and the years of Kohath's life were one hundred thirtythree years.\n6:19 And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.\n6:20 And Amram took Jochebed his father's sister for himself as wife, and she bore him Aaron and Moses; and the years of Amram's life were one hundred thirty seven years.\n6:21 And the sons of Izhar: Korah and Nepheg and Zichri.\n6:22 And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael and Elzaphan and Sithri.\n6:23  And Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, for himself as wife; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.\n6:24 And the sons of Korah: Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.\n6:25 And Eleazar, Aaron's son, took for himself one of the daughters of Putiel as wife, and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites according to their families.\n6:26 It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.\n6:27 It was they who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt; it is the same Moses and Aaron.\n6:28 And on the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,\n6:29 Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, I am Jehovah; speak to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, all that I speak to you.\n6:30 But Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips. How then will Pharaoh listen to me? /n/nExodus 7/n\n7:1 And Jehovah said to Moses, See, I have made you God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.\n7:2 You shall speak all that I command you, and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.\n7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart and will multiply My signs and My wonders in the land of Egypt.\n7:4 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay My hand upon Egypt and bring forth My armies, My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment.\n7:5  And the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth My hand upon Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.\n7:6 And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they do.\n7:7 And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eightythree years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.\n7:8 And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n7:9 When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, Perform a wonder; then you shall say to Aaron, Take your staff, and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it becomes a serpent.\n7:10 And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and they did just as Jehovah had commanded; and Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.\n7:11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret spells.\n7:12 That is, each one threw down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.\n7:13 And Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.\n7:14 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.\n7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and stand on the bank of the River to meet him. And you shall take in your hand the staff which was turned into a serpent.\n7:16 And you shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, Let My people go that they may serve Me in the wilderness. But until this very moment you have not listened.\n7:17 Thus says Jehovah, By this you will know that I am Jehovah. I am now going to strike the water which is in the River with the staff that is in my hand, and it will be turned to blood.\n7:18 And the fish that are in the River will die, and the River will become foul, and the Egyptians will loathe drinking water from the River.\n7:19 And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your staff, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their watercourses, and over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, even in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.\n7:20 And Moses and Aaron did just as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the River in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the River was turned to blood.\n7:21 And the fish that were in the River died, and the River became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the River; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.\n7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret spells; and Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.\n7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this to heart.\n7:24 And all the Egyptians dug around the River for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the River.\n7:25 And seven days passed after Jehovah had struck the River. /n/nExodus 8/n\n8:1 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Let My people go that they may serve Me.\n8:2 But if you refuse to let them go, I am now going to smite all your territory with frogs.\n8:3 And the River shall swarm with frogs, and they will go up from the river and come into your house and into your bedchamber and upon your bed, and into the houses of your servants and upon your people, and into your ovens and into your kneading bowls.\n8:4 And the frogs shall come up upon you and upon your people and upon all your servants.\n8:5  And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the watercourses, and over the pools, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.\n8:6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.\n8:7 And the magicians did the same with their secret spells and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.\n8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, Entreat Jehovah to take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will let the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.\n8:9 And Moses said to Pharaoh, May it please you, and not me, as to the time. When shall I make entreaty for you and for your servants and for your people, to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses so that they remain in the River only?\n8:10 And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, It will be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one like Jehovah our God.\n8:11 And the frogs shall depart from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people; they shall remain in the River only.\n8:12 Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to Jehovah concerning the frogs which He had brought upon Pharaoh.\n8:13 And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died in the houses, in the courts, and in the fields.\n8:14 And they gathered them together, heap after heap, and the land stank.\n8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.\n8:16 And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your staff, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.\n8:17  And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man and on beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.\n8:18 And the magicians did the same with their secret spells, to try to bring forth lice, but they could not; so there were lice on man and on beast.\n8:19 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had said.\n8:20 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and present yourself before Pharaoh as he is going out to the water, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, Let My people go that they may serve Me.\n8:21 For if you will not let My people go, then I will at once send swarms of flies against you and against your servants and against your people and against your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of flies, as well as the ground on which they are.\n8:22 But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are staying, so that no swarms of flies will be there, so that you may know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the land.\n8:23 And I will put redemption between My people and your people. Tomorrow this sign shall occur.\n8:24 And Jehovah did so; and heavy swarms of flies came into the house of Pharaoh and into his servants' houses, and throughout the land of Egypt the land was ruined because of the swarms of flies.\n8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.\n8:26 And Moses said, It would not be right to do so, for we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God what is an abomination to the Egyptians. If we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?\n8:27 We must go a three days' journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to Jehovah our God just as He commands us.\n8:28  And Pharaoh said, I will let you go that you may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away.

But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.\n9:8  Then Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Take handfuls of ashes from a furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.\n9:9 And it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and on beast throughout all the land of Egypt.\n9:10 So they took ashes from the furnace and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it toward heaven, and it became boils breaking forth with sores on man and on beast.\n9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.\n9:12 And Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not listen to them, just as Jehovah had spoken to Moses.\n9:13 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and present yourself before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let My people go that they may serve Me.\n9:14 For this time I am going to send all My plagues against you and on your servants and on your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth.\n9:15 For if by now I had stretched out My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would have been cut off from the earth.\n9:16 But indeed for this cause I have made you stand, to show you My power and to have My name proclaimed throughout all the earth.\n9:17 You are still exalting yourself against My people by not letting them go.\n9:18 Tomorrow about this time I am going to cause very heavy hail to fall, such as has never occurred in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.\n9:19 Now therefore send men and secure your livestock and all that you have in the field; every man and beast that is found in the field and is not brought home when the hail comes down shall die.\n9:20  He who feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses.\n9:21 But he who did not pay attention to the word of Jehovah left his servants and his livestock in the field.\n9:22 And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven that there may be hail throughout all the land of Egypt, upon man and upon beast and upon all the vegetation of the field in the land of Egypt.\n9:23 And Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven; and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire came down on the earth, and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.\n9:24 So there was very heavy hail with fire flashing continually in the midst of the hail, such as had not occurred in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.\n9:25 And the hail struck everything that was in the field, both man and beast, throughout all the land of Egypt; and the hail struck all the vegetation of the field and shattered every tree of the field.\n9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.\n9:27 And Pharaoh sent a messenger and called for Moses and Aaron; and he said to them, I have sinned this time; Jehovah is the righteous One, and I and my people are in the wrong.\n9:28 Entreat Jehovah, for there has been enough of God's thunder and hail; and I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.\n9:29 And Moses said to him, As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Jehovah; the thunder will cease, and there will not be any more hail, that you may know that the earth is Jehovah's.\n9:30 But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear Jehovah God.\n9:31 (Now the flax and the barley were ruined, for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bud.\n9:32 But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they had not come up.)\n9:33  And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to Jehovah; and the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the earth.\n9:34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his servants.\n9:35 So Pharaoh's heart hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, just as Jehovah had spoken through Moses. /n/nExodus 10/n\n10:1 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that I may show these signs of Mine in the midst of them,\n10:2 And that you may recount in the hearing of your son and your grandson how I made a mockery of Egypt and My signs which I have done among them, that you may know that I am Jehovah.\n10:3 And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go that they may serve Me.\n10:4 For if you refuse to let My people go, then tomorrow I am going to bring swarming locusts into your territory,\n10:5 And they will cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land; and they will eat the rest of what has escapedwhat is left to you from the hailand will eat up every tree of yours that is sprouting in the field.\n10:6 And your houses will be filled with them, as well as the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians; something that neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen since the day that they came upon the earth until this day. Then he turned and went out from Pharaoh.\n10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go that they may serve Jehovah their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is destroyed?\n10:8  So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. But who exactly are going?\n10:9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; we will go with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds, for we must hold Jehovah's feast.\n10:10 And he said to them, Let Jehovah indeed be with you if I ever let you go with your little ones as well. See here, you are up to some evil.\n10:11 No! Go now, but the men only, and serve Jehovah, since that is what you are requesting. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.\n10:12 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the swarming locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt and eat all the vegetation of the land, all that the hail has left.\n10:13 So Moses stretched forth his staff over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah drove an east wind upon the land all that day and all night; when it was morning, the east wind had brought the swarming locusts.\n10:14 And the swarming locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and settled in all the territory of Egypt in great mass. Before them there had never been so many swarming locusts as they, nor after them will there ever be so many.\n10:15 And they covered the surface of the whole land, so that the land was darkened. And they ate all the vegetation of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, and nothing green remained on the trees or among the vegetation of the field throughout all the land of Egypt.\n10:16 Then Pharaoh hurriedly called for Moses and Aaron and said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God and against you.\n10:17 Now therefore, please forgive my sin just this once, and entreat Jehovah your God that He would only remove this death from me.\n10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh and entreated Jehovah.\n10:19  And Jehovah changed the wind into a very strong west wind, and it took up the swarming locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust was left in all the territory of Egypt.\n10:20 But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.\n10:21 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness that can be felt.\n10:22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness throughout all the land of Egypt for three days.\n10:23 They could not see one another, nor did anyone rise up from his place for three days, but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.\n10:24 And Pharaoh called Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be detained. Your little ones may also go with you.\n10:25 And Moses said, You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings so that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.\n10:26 So our cattle also must go with us; not a hoof must be left behind, for we must take some of them to serve Jehovah our God, and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah until we go there.\n10:27 But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.\n10:28 And Pharaoh said to him, Get away from me. Be sure that you do not see my face again, for on the day you see my face you shall die.\n10:29 And Moses said, You have spoken correctly. I will never again see your face. /n/nExodus 11/n\n11:1 Then Jehovah said to Moses, One more plague will I bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely.\n11:2 Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man is to ask of his neighbor and each woman of her neighbor for articles of silver and articles of gold.\n11:3 And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people.\n11:4 And Moses said, Thus says Jehovah, About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt,\n11:5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits upon his throne to the firstborn of the female slave who is behind the millstones, and all the firstborn of cattle.\n11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as has not been or ever will be again.\n11:7 But a dog shall not bark at any of the children of Israel, at man or beast, that you may know that Jehovah makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.\n11:8 And all these servants of yours shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, Get out, you and all the people who follow you; and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.\n11:9 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh will not listen to you, in order that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.\n11:10 Thus Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land. /n/nExodus 12/n\n12:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,\n12:2 This month will be the beginning of months for you; it shall be the first of the months of the year to you.\n12:3  Speak to all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month each man shall take a lamb according to his fathers' house, a lamb for a household.\n12:4 And if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the persons in the houses; according to each man's eating you shall make your count for the lamb.\n12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a yearold male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.\n12:6 And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel shall kill it at twilight.\n12:7 And they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.\n12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread with bitter herbs.\n12:9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but roasted with fireits head with its legs and with its inward parts.\n12:10 And you shall not let any of it remain until the morning, but any of it that remains until the morning you shall burn with fire.\n12:11 And this is how you shall eat it: with your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste. It is Jehovah's passover.\n12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast. Also against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments. I am Jehovah.\n12:13 And the blood shall be a sign for you upon the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there will be no plague upon you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.\n12:14  And this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah; throughout your generations as a perpetual statute you shall keep it as a feast.\n12:15 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the first day you shall remove leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.\n12:16 And on the first day you shall have a holy convocation, and on the seventh day a holy convocation. No work at all shall be done on them, except to prepare what every person will eat, that alone may be done by you.\n12:17 And you shall keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall "));

For whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel, whether a sojourner or a native of the land.\n12:20 You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread.\n12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, Draw out and take lambs according to your families, and slaughter the passover.\n12:22 And you shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and you shall apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and to the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the entrance of his house until the morning.\n12:23 For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood upon the lintel and on the two doorposts, Jehovah will pass over the entrance and will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to smite you.\n12:24 And you shall observe this matter as a statute for you and for your sons in perpetuity.\n12:25  And when you come to the land which Jehovah will give you, as He has promised, you shall observe this service.\n12:26 And when your children say to you, What does this service mean to you?\n12:27 You shall say, It is the passover sacrifice to Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses. And the people bowed and worshipped.\n12:28 And the children of Israel went and did so; just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\n12:29 And at midnight Jehovah struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.\n12:30 And Pharaoh arose in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no house where there was not someone dead.\n12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron in the night and said, Rise up, go out from the midst of my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as you have said.\n12:32 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said; and go and bless me also.\n12:33 And the Egyptians urged the people, so as to hasten their departure out of the land, for they said, All of us will be dead.\n12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.\n12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses, and they asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and clothing.\n12:36 And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. Thus they plundered the Egyptians.\n12:37  And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.\n12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them, as well as flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.\n12:39 And they baked the dough which they brought out of Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it had not been leavened because they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay; nor had they prepared for themselves any provisions.\n12:40 Now the time of the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred thirty years.\n12:41 And at the end of four hundred thirty years, on that very day, all the armies of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.\n12:42 It was for Jehovah a night of watching, to bring them out from the land of Egypt. That same night is a night of watching to Jehovah for all the children of Israel throughout their generations.\n12:43 And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the statute of the passover: No foreigner shall eat of it.\n12:44 However any man's servant who is bought for silver, when you have circumcised him, then he shall eat of it.\n12:45 A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.\n12:46 It shall be eaten in one house. You shall not take any of the flesh outside the house, nor shall you break any of its bones.\n12:47 All the assembly of Israel shall keep it.\n12:48 But if a stranger sojourns with you and will observe the Passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near to observe it; and he will be like one who is a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.\n12:49 One law shall be for the native and for the stranger who sojourns among you.\n12:50 And all the children of Israel did so; just as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\n12:51 And on that very day Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. /n/nExodus 13/n\n13:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n13:2 Sanctify to Me all the firstborn: Whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast, it is Mine.\n13:3 And Moses said to the people, Remember this day on which you came out from Egypt, from the slave house, for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place; and nothing leavened shall be eaten.\n13:4 On this day in the month of Abib you are going out.\n13:5 And when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall observe this service in this month:\n13:6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to Jehovah.\n13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days, and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor shall any leaven be seen among you in all your territory.\n13:8 And you shall tell your son in that day, saying, It is because of what Jehovah did for me when I came out of Egypt.\n13:9 And it shall be for a sign to you upon your hand and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in your mouth; for with a mighty hand Jehovah brought you out of Egypt.\n13:10 You shall therefore keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.\n13:11 And when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and gives it to you,\n13:12 You shall set apart to Jehovah everything that opens the womb and the first offspring of every beast which is yours; the males shall be Jehovah's.\n13:13 And every first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you do not redeem it, you shall break its neck. And every firstborn male among your sons you shall redeem.\n13:14 And when your son asks you in time to come, saying, What is this? you shall say to him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the slave house.\n13:15 And when Pharaoh hardened himself against letting us go, Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast. Therefore I am one who sacrifices to Jehovah all that open the womb that are males; and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.\n13:16 So it will be as a sign upon your hand and as frontlets between your eyes, for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us out of Egypt.\n13:17 Now when Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Perhaps the people will change their minds when they see war and return to Egypt.\n13:18 Thus God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up arrayed for battle out of the land of Egypt.\n13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the children of Israel solemnly swear, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall bring my bones up from here with you.\n13:20 And they journeyed from Succoth and encamped in Etham on the edge of the wilderness.\n13:21 And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might go by day and by night.\n13:22  Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night departed from before the people. /n/nExodus 14/n\n14:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n14:2 Tell the children of Israel to turn back and camp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You shall camp before Baalzephon, opposite it, by the sea.\n14:3 And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has hemmed them in.\n14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue after them; and I will glorify Myself through Pharaoh and through all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.\n14:5 And when it was told to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, the heart of Pharaoh and his servants changed toward the people; and they said, What is this we have done, letting Israel go from serving us?\n14:6 So he yoked his chariot and took his people with him.\n14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them.\n14:8 And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, so that he pursued after the children of Israel as the children of Israel were going out with a high hand.\n14:9 And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army; and they overtook them as they encamped by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal zephon.\n14:10 And when Pharaoh approached, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and there the Egyptians were, marching after them; and they became very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to Jehovah.\n14:11  And they said to Moses, Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you done this to us, bringing us out of Egypt?\n14:12 Is this not the very thing that we spoke to you about in Egypt, saying, Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.\n14:13 But Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid; stand firm, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will see no more again forever.\n14:14 Jehovah will fight for you, and you will be still.\n14:15 And Jehovah said to Moses, Why do you cry out to Me? Tell the children of Israel to move forward.\n14:16 And you, lift up your staff, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.\n14:17 And I will now harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them; and I will glorify Myself through Pharaoh and through all his army, through his chariots and through his horsemen.\n14:18 Then the Egyptians will know that I am Jehovah when I glorify Myself through Pharaoh, through his chariots and through his horsemen.\n14:19 And the Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.\n14:20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. And the cloud was there with the darkness, yet it gave light by night to them. Thus one did not come near the other all night.\n14:21 And when Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, Jehovah caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night and made the sea dry land; and the waters were divided.\n14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.\n14:23  Then the Egyptians pursued; and all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen went in after them into the midst of the sea.\n14:24 And at the morning watch Jehovah looked down upon the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and of cloud and threw the camp of the Egyptians into confusion.\n14:25 And He caused their chariot wheels to swerve and made them drive with difficulty, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians.\n14:26 And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and over their horsemen.\n14:27 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its level when the morning appeared. And the Egyptians fled against it, and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.\n14:28 And as the waters returned, they covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; not even one of them was left.\n14:29 But the children of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.\n14:30 Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.\n14:31 And when Israel saw the great power which Jehovah exercised against the Egyptians, the people feared Jehovah; and they believed in Jehovah and in His servant Moses. /n/nExodus 15/n\n15:1 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Jehovah and spoke, saying, I will sing to Jehovah, for He has triumphed gloriously; The horse and its rider He has cast into the sea.\n15:2 Jah is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation; This is my God, and I will praise Him; My father's God, and I will exalt Him.\n15:3  Jehovah is a man of war; Jehovah is His name.\n15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea; And his choice officers have drowned in the Red Sea.\n15:5 The deep waters cover them; They went down into the depths like a stone.\n15:6 Your right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power; Your right hand, O Jehovah, dashed the enemy in pieces.\n15:7 And in the greatness of Your excellence You overthrew those who rose up against You. You sent forth Your burning wrath; It consumed them like stubble.\n15:8 And with the blast of Your nostrils the waters were heaped up; The flowing currents stood up like a heap; The deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.\n15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire will be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword; my hand will destroy them.\n15:10 You blew with Your wind; the sea covered them; They sank like lead in the mighty waters.\n15:11 Who is like You, O Jehovah, among the gods?

There He made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested them.\n15:26 And He said, If you will listen carefully to the voice of Jehovah your God and do what is right in His eyes and give ear to His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Jehovah who heals you.\n15:27 And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.  /n/nExodus 16/n\n16:1 And they journeyed from Elim, and all the assembly of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure out of the land of Egypt.\n16:2 And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.\n16:3 And the children of Israel said to them, If only we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots, when we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole congregation with hunger.\n16:4 Then Jehovah said to Moses, I will now rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My law.\n16:5 And on the sixth day when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.\n16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, In the evening you will know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt;\n16:7 And in the morning you will see the glory of Jehovah, for He hears your murmurings against Jehovah. And what are we, that you murmur against us?\n16:8 And Moses said, This you will see when Jehovah gives you flesh to eat in the evening, and bread to the full in the morning; for Jehovah hears your murmurings which you murmur against Him. And what are we? Your murmurings are not against us but against Jehovah.\n16:9 And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah, for He has heard your murmurings.\n16:10 And as Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and there the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.\n16:11  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n16:12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At twilight you will eat flesh, and in the morning you will be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am Jehovah your God.\n16:13 And at evening quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.\n16:14 And when the layer of dew lifted, there upon the surface of the wilderness were fine round flakes, fine as the frost on the earth.\n16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, What is it? For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.\n16:16 This is what Jehovah has commanded, Gather of it, each one according to his eating; you shall take an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, each one for those who are in his tent.\n16:17 And the children of Israel did so; and some gathered much, and some little.\n16:18 And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no lack; each of them gathered according to his eating.\n16:19 And Moses said to them, Let no man leave any of it until the morning.\n16:20 But they did not listen to Moses, and some men left part of it until the morning; and it bred worms and stank. And Moses was indignant with them.\n16:21 And they gathered it morning by morning, each one according to his eating; and when the sun became hot, it melted.\n16:22 And on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the leaders of the assembly came and told Moses.\n16:23 And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has spoken, Tomorrow is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy Sabbath to Jehovah. Bake what you will bake, and boil what you will boil, and all that is left  over put aside for yourselves to be kept until the morning.\n16:24 And they put it aside until the morning, as Moses commanded; and it did not stink, nor was there any worm in it.\n16:25 And Moses said, Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to Jehovah; today you will not find it in the field.\n16:26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath; on it there will be none.\n16:27 And on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.\n16:28 And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?\n16:29 See, Jehovah has given you the Sabbath, therefore He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Let each of you stay in his place; let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.\n16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.\n16:31 And the house of Israel called its name manna, and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste was like wafers made with honey.\n16:32 And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.\n16:33 And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and place it before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.\n16:34 As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the testimony to be kept.\n16:35 And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to inhabitable land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.\n16:36 Now an omer is a tenth of an ephah.  /n/nExodus 17/n\n17:1 And all the assembly of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin by their stages according to the command of Jehovah and encamped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.\n17:2 Therefore the people contended with Moses and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why are you contending with me? Why do you test Jehovah?\n17:3 So the people thirsted there for water, and the people murmured against Moses and said, For what reason did you bring us up out of Egypt; to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?\n17:4 So Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do with this people? A little more, and they will stone me.\n17:5 And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand your staff with which you struck the River, and go.\n17:6 I will be standing before you there upon the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it so that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.\n17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, because of the contention of the children of Israel and because they tested Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?\n17:8 Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.\n17:9 And Moses said to Joshua, Choose men for us, and go out; fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.\n17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.\n17:11 And when Moses lifted his hand up, Israel prevailed; and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed.\n17:12 But Moses' hands were heavy, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.\n17:13 And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\n17:14 And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.\n17:15 And Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovahnissi;\n17:16 For he said, For there is a hand against the throne of Jah! Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. /n/nExodus 18/n\n18:1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' fatherinlaw, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, how Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.\n18:2 And Jethro, Moses' fatherinlaw, had taken Moses' wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away,\n18:3 And her two sons, of whom the name of one was Gershom, for Moses said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land;\n18:4 And the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, The God of my father was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.\n18:5 So Jethro, Moses' fatherinlaw, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God.\n18:6 And he sent word to Moses: I, your fatherinlaw Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her.\n18:7 So Moses went out to meet his fatherinlaw and bowed down and kissed him; and each asked the other's welfare, and they came into the tent.\n18:8 And Moses told his fatherinlaw all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.\n18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the good which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that He had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.\n18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.\n18:11 Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; indeed, it was proven when they dealt proudly against the people.\n18:12 Then Jethro, Moses' fatherinlaw, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat food with Moses' father inlaw before God.\n18:13 And on the following day Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.\n18:14 And when Moses' fatherinlaw saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit by yourself, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?\n18:15 Then Moses said to his fatherinlaw, Because the people come to me to inquire of God.\n18:16 When they have a dispute, the matter comes to me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.\n18:17 And Moses' fatherinlaw said to him, The thing that you are doing is not good.\n18:18 You will surely wear yourself out, both you and this people who are with you, for the thing is too heavy for you; you cannot do it by yourself.\n18:19 Listen now to my voice: I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You stand for the people before God, and you bring the matters to God.\n18:20  And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known to them the way in which they should walk and the work that they should do.\n18:21 You also should look for able men among all the people who fear God, men of truth, who hate unjust gain; and place them over them, as leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.\n18:22 And let them judge the people at all times; and let them bring every great matter to you, but every small matter let them judge themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you.\n18:23 If you do this thing, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.\n18:24 So Moses listened to the voice of his fatherinlaw and did all that he had said.\n18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel and made them heads over the people: leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.\n18:26 And they judged the people at all times; the hard cases they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.\n18:27 And Moses let his fatherinlaw depart, and he went his way to his own land. /n/nExodus 19/n\n19:1 In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that very day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.\n19:2 And when they had journeyed from Rephidim and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped in front of the mountain.\n19:3 And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel:\n19:4  You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself.\n19:5 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My personal treasure from among all"));

These are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel.\n19:7 So Moses came and called for the elders of the people and set before them all these words which Jehovah had commanded him.\n19:8 And all the people answered together and said, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do. And Moses brought back the words of the people to Jehovah.\n19:9 And Jehovah said to Moses, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you and may also believe you forever. Then Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah,\n19:10 And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow; and have them wash their garments,\n19:11 And be ready for the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.\n19:12 And you shall set limits for the people all around, saying, Be careful that you do not go up on the mountain or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.\n19:13 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether beast or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.\n19:14 And Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.\n19:15 And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day. Do not go near a woman.\n19:16  And on the third day, when it was morning, there was thunder and lightning, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet sound; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.\n19:17 And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the base of the mountain.\n19:18 Now the whole of Mount Sinai smoked because Jehovah descended upon it in fire, and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly.\n19:19 And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in a voice.\n19:20 And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai at the top of the mountain, and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain; and Moses went up.\n19:21 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Go down; charge the people not to break through to Jehovah to look, lest many of them perish.\n19:22 And let the priests who come near to Jehovah also sanctify themselves, so that Jehovah does not break forth upon them.\n19:23 And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You charged us, saying, Set limits around the mountain, and sanctify it.\n19:24 And Jehovah said to him, Go, get down; then you shall come up again, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people force a way through to come up to Jehovah, so that He does not break forth upon them.\n19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them. /n/nExodus 20/n\n20:1 And God spoke all these words, saying,\n20:2 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the slave house;\n20:3 You shall have no other gods before Me.\n20:4 You shall not make for yourself an idol, nor the form of anything that is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water beneath the earth.\n20:5 You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them; for I, Jehovah your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,\n20:6 Yet showing lovingkindness to thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.\n20:7 You shall not take the name of Jehovah your God in vain, for Jehovah will not hold guiltless him who takes His name in vain.\n20:8 Remember the Sabbath day so as to sanctify it.\n20:9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,\n20:10 But the seventh day is a Sabbath to Jehovah your God; you shall not do any work, you nor your son nor your daughter, your male servant nor your female servant, nor your cattle nor the sojourner with you, who is within your gates.\n20:11 For in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day;

and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood at a distance.\n20:19 And they said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak with us, so we do not die.\n20:20 And Moses said to the people, Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him may be before you, so that you do not sin.\n20:21 And the people stood at a distance, and Moses drew near to the deep darkness where God was.\n20:22 And Jehovah said to Moses, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, You yourselves have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.\n20:23 You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.\n20:24 An altar of earth you shall make for Me, and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.\n20:25 And if you make Me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones; for if you lift up your tool upon it, you have polluted it.\n20:26 Neither shall you go up by steps to My altar, so that your nakedness may not be uncovered on it. /n/nExodus 21/n\n21:1 Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them.\n21:2  If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years;

I will not go out free;\n21:6 Then his master shall bring him to God and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him forever.\n21:7 And if a man sells his daughter as a female servant, she shall not go out as the male servants do.\n21:8 If she displeases her master, who has designated her for himself, then he shall let her be redeemed; he has no right to sell her to a foreign people, because he has dealt with her unfaithfully.\n21:9 And if he designated her for his son, he shall deal with her according to the custom of daughters.\n21:10 If he take another woman for himself, he shall not diminish her food, her clothing, or her marital rights.\n21:11 And if he does not do these three things for her, then shall she go out for nothing, without payment of silver.\n21:12 He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.\n21:13 But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God allowed him to fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place where he may flee to.\n21:14 And if a man acts presumptuously toward his neighbor, so as to slay him with guile, you shall take him even from My altar so that he may die.\n21:15 And he who strikes his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.\n21:16 And he who kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or he is found in his possession, shall surely be put to death.\n21:17 And he who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.\n21:18 And if men contend and one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist so that he does not die but remains in bed;\n21:19 If he can rise up and walk around outside on his staff, then he who struck him shall be guiltless; he shall only pay for the loss of his time, until he has made sure he is completely healed.\n21:20 And if a man strikes his male servant or his female servant with a rod, and the servant dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.\n21:21 But if he survives a day or two, he shall not be punished; for he is his prop erty.\n21:22 And if men struggle together, and they hit a pregnant woman, so that she has a miscarriage, but there is no further mishap, he shall surely be fined what the woman's husband shall impose upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine.\n21:23 But if there is further mishap, then you shall give a life for a life,\n21:24 An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,\n21:25 A burning for a burning, a wound for a wound, a stripe for a stripe.\n21:26 And if a man strikes the eye of his male servant or the eye of his female servant and destroys it, he shall let that one go free on account of that one's eye.\n21:27 And if he knocks out his male servant's tooth or his female servant's tooth, he shall let that one go free on account of that one's tooth.\n21:28 And if an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten;

he shall give silver to its owner, and the dead animal shall be his.\n21:35 And if one man's ox injures another's so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide its price; and they shall also divide the dead animal.\n21:36 Or if it is known that the ox was accustomed to goring previously and its owner would not keep it in, he shall surely give restitution, an ox for an ox, and the dead animal shall become his. /n/nExodus 22/n\n22:1 If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.\n22:2 If the thief is found breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him;\n22:3 Unless the sun has risen upon him, then there shall be bloodguiltiness for him.

Both Aaron and Hur are here with you; whoever has a cause, let him come near to them.\n24:15 And Moses went up to the top of the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.\n24:16 And the glory of Jehovah settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.\n24:17 And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like consuming fire on the top of the mountain to the eyes of the children of Israel.\n24:18 And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud and went up on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights. /n/nExodus 25/n\n25:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n25:2 Tell the children of Israel to take for Me a heave offering.

Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.\n31:15 Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to Jehovah; whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.\n31:16 Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.\n31:17 It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.\n31:18 And when He had finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, He gave to Moses the two tablets of the testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God. /n/nExodus 32/n\n32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered against Aaron and said to him, Come, make gods for us who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.\n32:2 And Aaron said to them, Tear off the gold rings, which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.\n32:3 And all the people tore off the golden rings which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron.\n32:4 And he took the gold from their hand and fashioned it with an engraving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!\n32:5 And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; then Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.\n32:6 And they rose up early on the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.\n32:7 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.\n32:8 They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made for themselves a molten calf, and they have worshipped it and have sacrificed to it and said, These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!\n32:9 And Jehovah said to Moses, I have seen this people, and there they are, a stiffnecked people.\n32:10 Now therefore let Me alone, that My anger may burn against them, and I may consume them; and I will make you into a great nation.\n32:11 And Moses entreated Jehovah his God and said, Jehovah, why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?\n32:12  Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, With evil intent He brought them out, to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from Your burning anger, and repent of this evil against Your people.\n32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants, to whom You swore by Yourself and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed, and they shall inherit it forever.\n32:14 Thus Jehovah repented of the evil which He said He would do to His people.\n32:15 Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand, tablets that were written on both of their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.\n32:16 And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved "));

And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him.\n32:27 And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Let each man put his sword upon his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each man kill his brother, and each man his companion, and each man his neighbor.\n32:28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and that day about three thousand men among the people fell.\n32:29 And Moses said, Fill your hands today to Jehovah, for every man has been against his son and against his brother, that He may bestow upon you a blessing today.\n32:30 And on the next day Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up to Jehovah; perhaps I can make expiation for your sin.\n32:31 And Moses returned to Jehovah and said, Oh, this people have committed a great sin and have made gods of gold for themselves.\n32:32 Yet now, if You will forgive their sinand if not, please blot me out of Your book which You have written.\n32:33 And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.\n32:34 And now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you.

And everyone who sought Jehovah went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.\n33:8 And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise up and stand, every man at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses, until he entered the tent.\n33:9 And whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stay at the entrance of the tent, and Jehovah would speak with Moses.\n33:10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, every man at the entrance of his tent.\n33:11 And Jehovah would speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his companion.

Yet You have said, I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.\n33:13 Now therefore if I have found favor in Your sight, please let me know now Your ways, that I may know You, so that I may continue to find favor in Your sight. Consider also that this nation is Your people.\n33:14 And He said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.\n33:15 And he said to Him, If Your presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.\n33:16 For how then shall it be known that I have found favor in Your sight, I and Your people?

Then Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai, just as Jehovah had commanded him; and he took two tablets of stone in his hand.\n34:5 And Jehovah descended in the cloud and took His place there with him and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.\n34:6 Then Jehovah passed by before him and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, God compassionate and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,\n34:7 Keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the grandchildren, to the third and fourth generations.\n34:8 And Moses made haste and bowed to the ground and worshipped.\n34:9 And he said, If now I have found favor in Your sight, O Lord, let the Lord please go in our midst; although they are a stiffnecked people, You pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for Your inheritance.\n34:10 And He said, Now I am going to make a covenant.

Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.\n34:19 All that opens the womb is Mine; even the first male produced by all your livestock, of cattle or sheep.\n34:20 And the first offspring of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck.

as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n40:33 And he raised up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and put up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.\n40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.\n40:35 And Moses was not able to enter the Tent of Meeting, because the cloud settled on it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.\n40:36 And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel set out on all their journeys;\n40:37 But if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up.\n40:38 For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel on all their journeys."));

And the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.\n9:7 Then Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, and make expiation for yourself and for the people; and make the offering of the people and make expiation for them; just as Jehovah has commanded.\n9:8 So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.\n9:9 And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.\n9:10 But the fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n9:11 And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.\n9:12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on and around the altar.\n9:13 And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head; and he burned them on the altar.\n9:14 And he washed the inward parts and the legs and burned them upon the burnt offering on the altar.\n9:15 Then he presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and slaughtered it and offered it for sin, like the first.\n9:16 And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.\n9:17 Then he presented the meal offering and filled his hand with some of it and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.\n9:18 Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron's sons handed the blood to him, which he sprinkled on and around the altar.\n9:19 And the fat portions of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and the fat which covers the inward parts and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver\n9:20 These fat portions they then put on the breasts; and he burned the fat portions on the altar.\n9:21 And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.\n9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.\n9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. And they came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.\n9:24 Then fire came forth from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they gave a ringing shout and fell on their faces.\n\nLeviticus 10\n\n10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in them and laid incense on it, and they presented strange fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them.\n10:2 And fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah.\n10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, This is what Jehovah spoke, saying, In those who come near to Me I will be sanctified, And before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron was silent.\n10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary to the outside of the camp.\n10:5  So they came near and carried them in their tunics to the outside of the camp, just as Moses had said.\n10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, Do not dishevel the hair of your heads, and do not tear your garments, that you may not die and that He may not be angry with all the assembly. But let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, weep for the burning which Jehovah has kindled.\n10:7 And you shall not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.\n10:8 Then Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying,\n10:9 Drink no wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the Tent of Meeting, that you may not die; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations,\n10:10 Both to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;\n10:11 And to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah has spoken to them through Moses.\n10:12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the meal offering which remains of Jehovah's offerings by fire, and eat it unleavened beside the altar; for it is most holy.\n10:13 And you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons' due of Jehovah's offerings by fire; for so I have been commanded.\n10:14 And the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons' due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.\n10:15 The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings by fire of the fat portions to wave as a wave offering before Jehovah, and it shall become a perpetual statute for you and for your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.\n10:16  Then Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, but it had already been burned. So he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,\n10:17 Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the assembly, to make expiation for them before Jehovah.\n10:18 Now its blood was not brought inside, into the sanctuary; you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded.\n10:19 But Aaron spoke to Moses, See, today they have presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and such things as these have befallen me! And if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of Jehovah?\n10:20 And when Moses heard that, it seemed good in his sight.\n\nLeviticus 11\n\n11:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,\n11:2 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the animals which you may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.\n11:3 Whatever has a divided hoof, that is, has its hoof split in two, and chews the cud among the beasts, that you may eat.\n11:4 However these you shall not eat: of those that only chew the cud or of those that only have a divided hoof: the camel, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.\n11:5 And the hyrax, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.\n11:6 And the hare, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.\n11:7 And the pig, for though it has a divided hoof, that is, it has its hoof split in two, it does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you.\n11:8  You shall not eat of their flesh, nor shall you touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.\n11:9 These you may eat of all that are in the water: anything in the water that has fins and scales, in the seas or in the rivers; these you may eat.\n11:10 But anything that does not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of anything that swarms in the waters and of any living animal which is in the waters, they are an abomination to you,\n11:11 And they shall be an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall regard as an abomination.\n11:12 Anything in the water that does not have fins or scales is an abomination to you.\n11:13 And these you shall regard as an abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten; they are an abomination: the great vulture and the bearded vulture and the black vulture\n11:14 And the kite and the falcon of every kind,\n11:15 Every raven of every kind,\n11:16 And the ostrich and the nighthawk and the sea gull and the hawk of every kind,\n11:17 And the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl\n11:18 And the screech owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture\n11:19 And the stork; the heron of every kind and the hoopoe and the bat;\n11:20 All flying insects that go on all fours are an abomination to you.\n11:21 Yet these you may eat of all flying insects that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet with which to leap on the earth;\n11:22 These of them you may eat: the swarming locust of every kind and the swallowing locust of every kind and the cricket of every kind and the grasshopper of every kind.\n11:23  But all the other flying insects which have four feet are an abomination to you.\n11:24 And by these you shall become unclean; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening,\n11:25 And whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.\n11:26 For every beast which has a divided hoof but does not have its hoof split in two or chew the cud is unclean to you; everyone who touches them shall be unclean.\n11:27 And whatever goes on its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.\n11:28 And the one who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.\n11:29 And these are unclean to you among the swarming things that swarm on the earth: the weasel and the mouse and the great lizard of every kind,\n11:30 And the gecko and the land crocodile and the lizard and the sand lizard and the chameleon.\n11:31 These are unclean to you among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.\n11:32 And anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is any article of wood or clothing or skin or sackcloth; any article which is used for any work must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean.\n11:33 And any earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and the vessel you shall break.\n11:34 Any food that could be eaten shall be unclean if water from such a vessel comes upon it, and any liquid that may be drunk shall be unclean if it was in any such vessel.\n11:35 And everything on which part of their carcass falls shall be uncleanan oven or a stove shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean and shall continue to be unclean to you.\n11:36 Nevertheless a spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, but whatever touches their carcass shall be unclean.\n11:37 And if any part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing, which is to be sown, it is clean.\n11:3"));

and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.\n15:25 And if a woman has a discharge of her blood for many days not at the time of her impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond the time of her impurity, during all the days of the discharge of her uncleanness she shall be as if in the days of her impurity; she is unclean.\n15:26 Any bed on which she lies during all the days of her discharge shall be to her like the bed of her impurity; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, as in the uncleanness of her impurity.\n15:27 And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water and be unclean until the evening.\n15:28 But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count seven days for herself;

He has uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.\n20:22 You shall therefore keep all My statutes and all My ordinances, and do them, so that the land into which I am bringing you to dwell in does not vomit you out.\n20:23 And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am about to send away before you. Because they did all these things, so I abhorred them.\n20:24 But I have said to you, You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am Jehovah your God, who has separated you from the peoples.\n20:25 You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean, and you shall not make your souls abominable by any beast or by any bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean.\n20:26 And you shall be holy to Me, because I Jehovah am holy, and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine.\n20:27 If there is a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist, they shall surely be put to death. They shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.\n\nLeviticus 21\n\n21:1 And Jehovah said to Moses, Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, No one shall defile himself for a dead person among his people,\n21:2 Except for his flesh who is near to him, for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his daughter and for his brother\n21:3 And for his virgin sister, who is near to him, who has had no husband; for her he may defile himself.\n21:4 He shall not defile himself, as a leader among his people, so as to profane himself.\n21:5 They shall not make any baldness on their head or shave off the edges of their beard or make any cuttings in their flesh.\n21:6 They shall be holy to their God, and they shall not profane the name of their God, for they present Jehovah's offerings by fire, the food of their God; therefore they shall be holy.\n21:7  They shall not take a woman who is a harlot or profaned, nor shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for the priest is holy to his God.\n21:8 You shall sanctify him therefore, for he presents the food of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I Jehovah, who sanctifies you, am holy.\n21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself through prostitution, she profanes her father; she shall be burnt with fire.\n21:10 And he who is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has filled his hands to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose nor tear his clothes.\n21:11 Neither shall he approach any dead person nor defile himself even for his father or for his mother.\n21:12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him; I am Jehovah.\n21:13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.\n21:14 A widow or a divorced woman or a profaned woman, a harlot, these he shall not take; but rather a virgin of his own people he shall take as wife.\n21:15 And he shall not profane his seed among his people, for I am Jehovah who sanctifies him.\n21:16 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n21:17 Speak to Aaron, saying, No one of your seed throughout their generations who has a defect shall approach to present the food of his God.\n21:18 For no one who has a defect shall approach: one who is blind or lame or with a disfigured nose or with an extended limb,\n21:19 Or one who has a broken foot or a broken hand,\n21:20 Or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scale or crushed testicles.\n21:21 No one of the seed of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall come near to present Jehovah's offerings by fire. He has a defect; he shall not come near to present the food of his God.\n21:22 He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy,\n21:23 But he shall not go in unto the veil or come near to the altar, because he has a defect, so that he does not profane My holy places; for I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.\n21:24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel.\n\nLeviticus 22\n\n22:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n22:2 Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy things of the children of Israel, which they sanctify to Me, so that they do not profane My holy name; I am Jehovah.\n22:3 Say to them, If anyone among all your seed throughout your generations who approaches the holy things, which the children of Israel sanctify to Jehovah, and his uncleanness is upon him, that person shall be cut off from before Me; I am Jehovah.\n22:4 No one of the seed of Aaron who is a leper or who has a discharge may eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whoever touches anything that is unclean because of contact with a dead person, or a man whose seed of copulation has gone from him,\n22:5 Or whoever touches any creeping thing by which he may be made unclean, or a man by whom he may be made unclean, whatever his uncleanness,\n22:6 The person who touches any such thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed his body in water.\n22:7 And when the sun sets, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his food.\n22:8  He shall not eat an animal which has died or is torn by beasts to become unclean by it; I am Jehovah.\n22:9 They shall therefore keep My charge, so that they do not bring sin upon themselves because of it and die by it because they profane it; I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.\n22:10 No stranger may eat any holy thing; a sojourner with a priest or a hired servant shall not eat any holy thing.\n22:11 But if a priest acquires anyone through a purchase with his money, that one may eat of it; and those who are born in his house may eat of his food.\n22:12 And if a priest's daughter is married to a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.\n22:13 But if a priest's daughter becomes a widow or divorced and has no child, and she returns to her father's house as in her youth, she may eat of her father's food; but no stranger may eat of it.\n22:14 And if a man eats the holy thing in ignorance, then he shall add onefifth of its value to it and shall give the holy thing to the priest.\n22:15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel that they offer to Jehovah,\n22:16 And so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when they eat their holy things; for I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.\n22:17 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n22:18 Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, When anyone of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel who presents his offering, whether it is any of their vows or any of their freewill offerings which they present to Jehovah for a burnt offering;\n22:19 It shall be a male without blemish from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats, for you to be accepted.\n22:20 But whatever has a blemish, you shall not present, for it will not be acceptable for you.\n22:21  And whoever presents a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah to make a special vow or for a freewill offering, from the herd or from the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it.\n22:22 You shall not present these to Jehovah: anything blind or injured or maimed or having a suppuration or eczema or scale; nor shall you make an offering by fire from them on the altar to Jehovah.\n22:23 An ox or a lamb that has anything superfluous or lacking in its parts, that you may offer for a freewill offering; but it shall not be accepted for a vow.\n22:24 And anything with its testicles bruised or crushed or broken or cut, you shall not present to Jehovah; you shall not do this in your land.\n22:25 And from the hand of a foreigner you shall not present the food of your God from any of these, because their corruption is in them. There is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you.\n22:26 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n22:27 When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day and onward it shall be accepted for the offering of an offering by fire to Jehovah.\n22:28 But whether cow or sheep, you shall not slaughter both it and its young on one day.\n22:29 And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.\n22:30 On the same day it shall be eaten; you shall leave none of it until the morning; I am Jehovah.\n22:31 Therefore you shall keep My commandments and do them; I am Jehovah.\n22:32 And you shall not profane My holy name, but I will be sanctified among the children of Israel; I am Jehovah who sanctifies you,\n22:33 Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am Jehovah.\n\nLeviticus 23\n\n23:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n23:2 Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, As to the appointed feasts of Jehovah, which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, these are My appointed feasts.\n23:3 Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day there is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation.

It shall be a jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his possession, and each of you shall return to his family.\n25:11 The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; you shall not sow nor reap its aftergrowth nor gather from its unpruned vines.\n25:12 For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce out of the field.\n25:13 In this year of jubilee each one of you shall return to his possession.\n25:14 And if you sell anything to your fellow countryman or buy from the hand of your fellow countryman, you shall not wrong one another.\n25:15 According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy from your fellow countryman; according to the number of crop years remaining he shall sell to you.\n25:16 According to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price; for it is the number of crop years that he sells to you.\n25:17 And you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Jehovah your God.\n25:18 Thus you shall observe My statutes, and you shall keep My ordinances and observe them, so that you dwell securely in the land.\n25:19  Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat to be satisfied and dwell securely in it.\n25:20 And if you should say, What shall we eat the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our produce?\n25:21 Then I will command My blessing for you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for three years.\n25:22 When you sow in the eighth year you will eat of the old produce until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat the old produce.\n25:23 And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, because the land is Mine; for with Me you are strangers and sojourners.\n25:24 And in all the land of your possession you shall provide for the redemption of the land.\n25:25 If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his possession, then his redeemer, the nearest relative, shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.\n25:26 But if a man does not have anyone to redeem it, but he obtains the means and finds it sufficient to redeem it,\n25:27 Then let him calculate the years since its sale and restore the excess to the man to whom he sold it, and return to his possession.\n25:28 But if he has not found sufficient means to restore it for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of the one who has purchased it until the year of jubilee; and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.\n25:29 And if anyone sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the end of a year from its sale; for a full year he shall have the right of redemption.\n25:30 But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall pass in perpetuity to the one who purchased it throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee.\n25:31  But the houses of the villages which have no wall all around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.\n25:32 As for the cities of the Levites, that is, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites shall have the permanent right of redemption.\n25:33 And what can be redeemed from the Levites, that is, a house that was sold in a city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.\n25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.\n25:35 And if your brother becomes poor, and he is unable to support himself as he lives beside you, then you shall support him, like a stranger and a sojourner, so that he may live beside you.\n25:36 Do not take any interest or gain from him, but fear your God, so that your brother may live beside you.\n25:37 You shall not give him your money at interest nor give him your food for gain.\n25:38 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.\n25:39 And if your brother beside you becomes poor, and he sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave.\n25:40 He shall be beside you as a hired servant, as a sojourner; he shall serve beside you until the year of jubilee.\n25:41 Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and return to his own family, and he shall return to the possession of his forefathers.\n25:42 For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold.\n25:43 You shall not rule over him with severity, but you shall fear your God.\n25:44  And as for your male slaves and female slaves whom you may have, they shall come from the nations that are around you; from them you may buy male slaves and female slaves.\n25:45 Moreover from the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, from them you may buy, and from their families who are with you, which they have begotten in your land; they also may be your possession.\n25:46 And you shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to receive as a possession; you may use them as permanent slaves. But you shall not rule over your brothers the children of Israel, one over another, with severity.\n25:47 And if a stranger or sojourner with you can afford it, and your brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you, or to the descendants of the stranger's family;\n25:48 After he has sold himself, he may be redeemed; one of his brothers may redeem him,\n25:49 Or his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him, or any of his close relatives of his family may redeem him; or if he can afford it, he may redeem himself.\n25:50 And he shall reckon with the one who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years. The time he shall be with him shall be calculated like the time of a hired servant.\n25:51 If there are still many years, in proportion to them he shall give back the amount for his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.\n25:52 And if there are only a few years remaining until the year of jubilee, so he shall reckon with him.

and your land will become a desolation, and your cities will become a waste.\n26:34 Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths during all the days of desolation while you are in your enemies' land; then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.\n26:35 During all the days of desolation it will have the rest, which it did not have on your Sabbaths when you were dwelling upon it.\n26:36 And as for those who remain among you, I will send faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they will flee as one flees from the sword; and they will fall though no one pursues.\n26:37 And they will stumble over one another, as if fleeing before the sword, though no one pursues; and you will not be able to stand before your enemies.\n26:38 And you will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.\n26:39  And those who are remaining among you will rot away because of their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they will rot away with them.\n26:40 But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also that they walked contrary to Me,\n26:41 So that I also walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and then they accept the punishment of their iniquity;\n26:42 Then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac and also My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.\n26:43 For the land will be abandoned by them and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it is desolate without them. And they will accept the punishment of their iniquity because, even because, they rejected My ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes.\n26:44 And yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God.\n26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations so that I might be their God; I am Jehovah.\n26:46 These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between Himself and the children of Israel at Mount Sinai through Moses.\n\nLeviticus 27\n\n27:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n27:2 Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When a man makes a special vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah according to your valuation.\n27:3 If your valuation is for the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary.\n27:4  And if it is for a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.\n27:5 And if it is for one aged from five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.\n27:6 And if it is for one aged from a month old even to five years old, then your valuation for the male shall be five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.\n27:7 And if it is for one aged from sixty years old and upward, if it is for a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.\n27:8 But if it is for him who is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him.\n27:9 And if it is for an animal which may be presented to Jehovah as an offering, anything which may be given to Jehovah shall be holy.\n27:10 He may not exchange it or substitute it, either a good one for a bad one or a bad one for a good one; but if he does indeed substitute animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall be holy.\n27:11 And if his vow is for any unclean animal, which may not be presented as an offering to Jehovah, then he shall set the animal before the priest,\n27:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as you the priest value it, so it shall be.\n27:13 But if he ever redeems it, then he shall add onefifth of it to your valuation.\n27:14 And if anyone consecrates his house to be holy to Jehovah, then the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; just as the priest values it, so it shall stand.\n27:15 And if the one who consecrated it redeems his house, then he shall add onefifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall become his.\n27:16 And if a man consecrates to Jehovah part of a field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.\n27:17  If he consecrates his field from the year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.\n27:18 But if he consecrates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the money for him according to the years which remain until the year of jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation.\n27:19 And if the one who consecrated the field ever redeems it, then he shall add onefifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be assured to him.\n27:20 But if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore.\n27:21 But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to Jehovah as a devoted field; its possession shall be the priest's.\n27:22 And if he consecrates to Jehovah a field which he has bought that is not part of the field of his possession,\n27:23 Then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation until the year of jubilee, and on that day he shall give your valuation as holy to Jehovah.\n27:24 In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, even to the one to whom the possession of the land belongs.\n27:25 And every valuation of yours shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.\n27:26 However no one shall consecrate the firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to Jehovah; whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is Jehovah's.\n27:27 But if it is consecrated from among unclean animals, then he shall ransom it according to your valuation and shall add to it onefifth of it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.\n27:28 Nevertheless anything which someone devotes to Jehovah out of all that he has, whether a human or an animal or a field of his possession, it shall not be sold or redeemed. Every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah.\n27:29 No human beings who are devoted to destruction shall be ransomed; they shall surely be put to death.\n27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovah's; it is holy to Jehovah.\n27:31 And if anyone redeems any of his tithe, he shall add to it onefifth of it.\n27:32 And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the shepherd's rod, the tenth one shall be holy to Jehovah.\n27:33 He shall not search whether it is good or bad, nor shall he substitute it; but if he does substitute it at all, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.\n27:34 These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses on Mount Sinai for the children of Israel."));

Numbers\n\nNumbers 1\n\n1:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,\n1:2 Take the sum of all the assembly of the children of Israel, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, every male, head by head.\n1:3 From twenty years old and upward, all who are able to go forth for military service in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their companies.\n1:4 And with you there shall be a man from every tribe, each man the head of his fathers' household.\n1:5 And these are the names of the men who shall stand with you. From Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur.\n1:6 From Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\n1:7 From Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab.\n1:8 From Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar.\n1:9 From Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon.\n1:10 From the children of Joseph: from Ephraim: Elishama the son of Ammihud;

they were the heads of the thousands of Israel.\n1:17 And Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name.\n1:18 And on the first day of the second month they gathered all the assembly together; and they registered themselves by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names from twent and upward, head by head.\n1:19 As Jehovah commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.\n1:20 And the children of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:21 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben: fortysix thousand five hundred.\n1:22 From the children of Simeon, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, those who were numbered of them, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:23 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Simeon: fiftynine thousand three hundred.\n1:24 From the children of Gad, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:25 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad: fortyfive thousand six hundred fifty.\n1:26 From the children of Judah, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:27 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Judah: seventyfour thousand six hundred.\n1:28 From the children of Issachar, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:29 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Issachar: fiftyfour thousand four hundred.\n1:30 From the children of Zebulun, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:31 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Zebulun: fiftyseven thousand four hundred.\n1:32 From the children of Joseph: from the children of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:33 Those who were numbered of them, from the tribe of Ephraim: forty thousand five hundred.\n1:34 And from the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:35 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Manasseh: thirtytwo thousand two hundred.\n1:36 From the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:37 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Benjamin: thirtyfive thousand four hundred.\n1:38 From the children of Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:39 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan: sixtytwo thousand seven hundred.\n1:40  From the children of Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:41 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Asher: fortyone thousand five hundred.\n1:42 From the children of Naphtali, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service;\n1:43 Those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Naphtali: fiftythree thousand four hundred.\n1:44 These were the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each one for his fathers' household.\n1:45 So all who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' households, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go forth for military service in Israel,\n1:46 Even all the numbered men were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.\n1:47 But the Levites were not numbered among them by their fathers' tribe.\n1:48 For Jehovah had spoken to Moses, saying,\n1:49 Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall you take the sum of them among the children of Israel;\n1:50 But you, appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony and over all its furnishings and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they shall minister to it and shall encamp around the tabernacle.\n1:51 And when the tabernacle sets out, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites shall set it up. But the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.\n1:52 And the children of Israel shall encamp, each one by his own camp and each one by his own standard, according to their companies.\n1:53  But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony, that there be no wrath upon the assembly of the children of Israel. And the Levites shall keep the charge of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.\n1:54 Thus did the children of Israel do; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, so they did.\n\nNumbers 2\n\n2:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n2:2 The children of Israel shall encamp each by his own standard with the ensigns of their fathers' households; they shall encamp facing the Tent of Meeting on every side.\n2:3 And those who encamp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their companies; and the leader of the children of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab;\n2:4 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: seventyfour thousand six hundred.\n2:5 And those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar; and the leader of the children of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar;\n2:6 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: fiftyfour thousand four hundred.\n2:7 Then the tribe of Zebulun; and the leader of the children of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon;\n2:8 And his company, that is, his numbered men: fiftyseven thousand four hundred.\n2:9 All who were numbered of the camp of Judah: one hundred eightysix thousand four hundred, according to their companies. They shall set out first.\n2:10 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their companies; and the leader of the children of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur;\n2:11 And his company, that is, his numbered men: fortysix thousand five hundred.\n2:12 And those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon; and the leader of the children of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;\n2:13 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: fiftynine thousand three hundred.\n2:14 Then the tribe of Gad; and the leader of the children of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Reuel;\n2:15 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: fortyfive thousand six hundred fifty.\n2:16 All who were numbered of the camp of Reuben: one hundred fiftyone thousand four hundred fifty, according to their companies. And they shall set out second.\n2:17 Then the Tent of Meeting shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; as they encamp, so shall they set out, every man in his place, by their standards.\n2:18 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their companies; and the leader of the children of Ephraim: Elishama the son of Ammihud;\n2:19 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: forty thousand five hundred.\n2:20 And next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh; and the leader of the children of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;\n2:21 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: thirtytwo thousand two hundred.\n2:22 Then the tribe of Benjamin; and the leader of the children of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni;\n2:23 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: thirtyfive thousand four hundred.\n2:24 All who were numbered of the camp of Ephraim: one hundred eight thousand one hundred, according to their companies. And they shall set out third.\n2:25 On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their companies; and the leader of the children of Dan: Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;\n2:26 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: sixtytwo thousand seven hundred.\n2:27 And those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher; and the leader of the children of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ochran;\n2:28 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: fortyone thousand five hundred.\n2:29 Then the tribe of Naphtali; and the leader of the children of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan;\n2:30 And his company, that is, those who were numbered of them: fiftythree thousand four hundred.\n2:31 All who were numbered of the camp of Dan: one hundred fiftyseven thousand six hundred. They shall set out last by their standards.\n2:32 These are those who were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' households. All who were numbered in the camps according to their companies were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.\n2:33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n2:34 Thus did the children of Israel do. According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards and so they set out, every one by their families, according to their fathers' households.\n\nNumbers 3\n\n3:1 Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses at the time when Jehovah spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.\n3:2 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar;\n3:3 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, whose hands were filled to serve as priests.\n3:4  But Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah when they offered strange fire before Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the presence of Aaron their father.\n3:5 And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n3:6 Bring the tribe of Levi near and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.\n3:7 And they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole assembly before the Tent of Meeting to do the service of the tabernacle.\n3:8 And they shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting and the charge of the children of Israel to do the service of the tabernacle.\n3:9 And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given to him from among the children of Israel.\n3:10 And you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood; but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.\n3:11 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n3:12 As for Me, I have now taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the children of Israel. So the Levites shall be Mine.\n3:13 For all the firstborn are Mine; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They shall be Mine; I am Jehovah.\n3:14 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,\n3:15 Number the children of Levi by their fathers' households, by their families; every male from a month old and upward you shall number.\n3:16 And Moses numbered them according to the word of Jehovah, as he was commanded.\n3:17 And these were the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon and Kohath and Merari.\n3:18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon according to their families: Libni and Shimei.\n3:19 And the sons of Kohath by their families: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.\n3:20 And the sons of Merari according to their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers' households.\n3:21 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites and the family of the Shimeites; these are the families of the Gershonites.\n3:22 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those who were numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred.\n3:23 The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind the tabernacle on the west.\n3:24 And the leader of the father's household of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.\n3:25 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting shall be the tabernacle and the tent, its covering and the screen for the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,\n3:26 And the hangings of the court, and the screen for th"));

They shall encamp on the side of the tabernacle to the north.\n3:36 And the appointed charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle and its bars and its pillars and its sockets and all its equipment and all the service pertaining to it,\n3:37 And the pillars around the court and their sockets and their pegs and their cords.\n3:38 And those who encamp before the tabernacle to the east, before the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise, shall be Moses and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.\n3:39 All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward were twentytwo thousand.\n3:40 And Jehovah said to Moses, Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.\n3:41 And you shall take the Levites for MeI am Jehovahinstead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the children of Israel.\n3:42 And Moses numbered, just as Jehovah commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.\n3:43  And all the firstborn males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them were twentytwo thousand two hundred seventythree.\n3:44 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n3:45 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be Mine; I am Jehovah.\n3:46 And for the redemption of the two hundred seventythree of the firstborn of the children of Israel over and above the number of the Levites,\n3:47 You shall take five shekels apiece per head; according to the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them. (The shekel is twenty gerahs.)\n3:48 And you shall give the money, by which the excess number of them is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons.\n3:49 So Moses took the redemption money from those who were over and above those who were redeemed by the Levites;\n3:50 From the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money, a thousand three hundred sixtyfive shekels according to the shekel of the sanctuary.\n3:51 And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n\nNumbers 4\n\n4:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n4:2 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers' households,\n4:3 From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, all who enter into the service to perform the skilled work in the Tent of Meeting.\n4:4  This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting concerning the most holy things.\n4:5 When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in, and they shall take down the veil of the screen and cover the Ark of the Testimony with it,\n4:6 And they shall put on it a covering of porpoise skin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue strands, and shall put in its poles.\n4:7 And over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall spread a blue cloth, and put on it the plates and the spoons and the bowls and the pitchers of the drink offering; and the continual bread shall be on it.\n4:8 And they shall spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put in its poles.\n4:9 And they shall take a blue cloth, and cover the lampstand of the light and its lamps and its tongs and its firepans and all its oil vessels with which they minister to it.\n4:10 And they shall put it and all its utensils within a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put it on the carrying frame.\n4:11 And over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put in its poles.\n4:12 And they shall take all the utensils of ministry with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth, and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put them on the carrying frame.\n4:13 And they shall remove the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it.\n4:14 And they shall put upon it all its utensils with which they minister upon it, the firepans, the forks, and the shovels, and the basinsall the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread over it a covering of porpoise skin, and put in its poles.\n4:15 And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, whenever the camp sets out, then the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them; but  they shall not touch the holy things, or they will die.

otherwise they will die.\n4:21 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n4:22 Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers' households, by their families;\n4:23 From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old you shall number them, everyone who enters to carry out the service to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.\n4:24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens:\n4:25 They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the Tent of Meeting, its covering, and the covering of porpoise skin that is on top of it, and the screen for the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,\n4:26 And the hangings of the court, and the screen for the entrance of the gate of the court, which is around the tabernacle and around the altar, and their cords, and all the equipment for their service;

and you shall assign by name the equipment they have been charged to carry.\n4:33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the Tent of Meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.\n4:34 And Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the assembly numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families and by their fathers' households,\n4:35 From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered into the service for work in the Tent of Meeting.\n4:36 And those who were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred fifty.\n4:37 These are those who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.\n4:38 And those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon by their families and by their fathers' households,\n4:39 From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered into the service for work in the Tent of Meeting,\n4:40  Even those who were numbered of them, by their families, by their fathers' households were two thousand six hundred thirty.\n4:41 These were those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah.\n4:42 And those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers' households,\n4:43 From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered into the service for work in the Tent of Meeting,\n4:44 Even those who were numbered of them by their families were three thousand two hundred.\n4:45 These were those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.\n4:46 All those who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers' households,\n4:47 From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered to do the work of service and the work of bearing burdens in the Tent of Meeting,\n4:48 Even those who were numbered of them were eight thousand five hundred eighty.\n4:49 According to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses they were numbered, everyone according to his service and according to his burden; thus they were numbered by him, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n\nNumbers 5\n\n5:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n5:2 Command the children of Israel that they send out of the camp every leper and everyone that has a discharge and everyone who is unclean because of a dead person.\n5:3 You shall send out both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp so that they will not defile their camp, where I dwell in their midst.\n5:4 And the children of Israel did so and sent them outside the camp; just as Jehovah had spoken to Moses, so the children of Israel did.\n5:5 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n5:6 Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit, so as to act unfaithfully toward Jehovah, and that person realizes his guilt,\n5:7 Then they shall confess their sin which they have committed, and he shall make restitution according to its principal for his wrong and add to it onefifth of it and give it to the one whom he has wronged.\n5:8 But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made for the wrong goes to Jehovah for the priest, in addition to the ram of the expiation, by which expiation is made for him.\n5:9 And every heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.\n5:10 And everyone's holy things shall be his; whatever anyone gives to the priest, it becomes his.\n5:11 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n5:12 Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, If any man's wife goes astray and acts unfaithfully toward him,\n5:13 And a man lies with her and has sexual relations, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected, and she is defiled, and there is no witness against her since she was not caught in the act;\n5:14 And a spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she has defiled herself; or if a spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she has not defiled herself;\n5:15 Then the man shall bring his wife to the priest and bring her offering for her, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense on it; for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.\n5:16 And the priest shall bring her near and set her before Jehovah.\n5:17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and the priest shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.\n5:18 And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah and let the hair of the woman's head go loose and put the meal offering of remembrance in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest shall be the water of bitterness that brings the curse.\n5:19 And the priest shall make her take an oath and shall say to the woman, If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray to uncleanness while under the authority of your husband, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings the curse.\n5:20 But if you have gone astray while under the authority of your husband and if you have defiled yourself, and a man besides your husband has lain with you\n5:21 Then the priest shall make the woman take an oath with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the womanJehovah make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Jehovah makes your thigh waste away and your womb swell;\n5:22 And this water that "));

And the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.\n5:23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness.\n5:24 And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse; and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.\n5:25 And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and he shall wave the meal offering before Jehovah and bring it to the altar.\n5:26  And the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering as its memorial portion and burn it upon the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water.\n5:27 And when he has made her drink the water, then if she has defiled herself and has acted unfaithfully to her husband, the water that brings the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her womb will swell, and her thigh will waste away; and the woman shall be a curse among her people.\n5:28 But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she will be immune and able to conceive seed.\n5:29 This is the law of jealousy when a wife, while under the authority of her husband, goes astray and defiles herself,\n5:30 Or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife. He shall set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall apply to her all this law.\n5:31 And the man shall be free from iniquity, but that woman shall bear her iniquity.\n\nNumbers 6\n\n6:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n6:2 Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazarite, to separate himself to Jehovah,\n6:3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh or dried grapes.\n6:4 All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skin.\n6:5 All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to Jehovah; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.\n6:6  All the days that he separates himself to Jehovah he shall not come near a dead person.\n6:7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God is upon his head.\n6:8 All the days of his separation he is holy to Jehovah.\n6:9 And if anyone dies very suddenly beside him so that he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall shave his head on the day he becomes clean; on the seventh day shall he shave it.\n6:10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,\n6:11 And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make expiation for him because he sinned by reason of the dead person. And he shall sanctify his head that same day.\n6:12 And he shall separate to Jehovah the days of his separation and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering, but the former days shall be void because his separation was defiled.\n6:13 Now this is the law of the Nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled: He shall be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.\n6:14 And he shall present his offering to Jehovah: one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one female lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace offering,\n6:15 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering and their drink offerings.\n6:16 And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.\n6:17 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall also offer its meal offering and its drink offering.\n6:18  And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and take the hair of the head of his separation and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.\n6:19 And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them into the hands of the Nazarite after he has shaved the head of his separation;\n6:20 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Jehovah. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and thigh of the heave offering. And afterward the Nazarite may drink wine.\n6:21 This is the law of the Nazarite who vows, that is, of his offering to Jehovah for his separation, in addition to what he can afford; according to his vow which he vows, so he must do according to the law of his separation.\n6:22 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n6:23 Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the children of Israel; you shall say to them,\n6:24 Jehovah bless you and keep you;\n6:25 Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you;\n6:26 Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.\n6:27 So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, that I Myself may bless them.\n\nNumbers 7\n\n7:1 And on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it and all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils, and had anointed them and sanctified them,\n7:2  The leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' households (they were the leaders of the tribes, who were over those who had been numbered), presented their offering.\n7:3 And they brought their offering before Jehovah: six covered wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the leaders and an ox for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle.\n7:4 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n7:5 Take these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to each according to his service.\n7:6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.\n7:7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon according to their service;\n7:8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.\n7:9 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they bore this upon their shoulder.\n7:10 And the leaders presented offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed; that is, the leaders presented their offering before the altar.\n7:11 And Jehovah said to Moses, They shall present their offering, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.\n7:12 And he who presented his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah.\n7:13 And his offering was one silver plate; its weight was one hundred thirty shekels; one silver bowl of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering;\n7:14 One golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense;\n7:15  One bull of the herd, one ram, one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering;\n7:16 One male of the goats for a sin offering;\n7:17 And for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five male lambs a year old.

From its base to its flowers it was beaten work; according to the pattern which Jehovah had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.\n8:5 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n8:6 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them.\n8:7 And thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: Sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them pass a razor over all their flesh and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves.\n8:8 Then let them take a bull of the herd and its meal offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and a second bull of the herd you shall take for a sin offering.\n8:9 And you shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting, and gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel.\n8:10 And you shall present the Levites before Jehovah, and the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites.\n8:11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah as a wave offering from the children of Israel, that they may do the service of Jehovah.\n8:12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to Jehovah to make expiation for the Levites.\n8:13 And you shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Jehovah.\n8:14 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be Mine.\n8:15 Then after this the Levites may go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. So you shall cleanse them and offer them as a wave offering.\n8:16 For they are wholly given to Me from among the children of Israel; I have taken them for Myself instead of everyone who opens the womb, the firstborn of all the children of Israel.\n8:17 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine, both human and animal. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for Myself.\n8:18 And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.\n8:19 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make expiation for the children of Israel, that there may be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.\n8:20 Thus did Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly of the children of Israel do to the Levites; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them.\n8:21 And the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes. Then Aaron offered them as a wave offering before Jehovah, and Aaron made expiation for them to cleanse them.\n8:22  And after this the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and before his sons; as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.\n8:23 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n8:24 This is what applies to the Levites: From twentyfive years old and upward they shall go in to perform the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting.\n8:25 And from the age of fifty years they shall retire from the service in the work and shall serve no more.\n8:26 But they may minister to their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to keep the charge, but they themselves shall do no service. Thus you shall do with the Levites concerning their charges.\n\nNumbers 9\n\n9:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,\n9:2 Let the children of Israel keep the passover at its appointed time.\n9:3 On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall keep it.\n9:4 Thus Moses told the children of Israel to keep the passover.\n9:5 And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.\n9:6 And there were certain men who were unclean through contact with a dead person, so that they could not keep the passover on that day; so they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.\n9:7  And those men said to him, Although we are unclean through contact with a dead person, why must we be kept from presenting the offering of Jehovah at its appointed time among the children of Israel?\n9:8 And Moses said to them, Stay here, so I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.\n9:9 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n9:10 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Any one of you or your descendants who becomes unclean through contact with a dead person or is on a distant journey shall still keep the passover to Jehovah.\n9:11 In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.\n9:12 They shall not leave any of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it; according to every statute of the passover they shall keep it.\n9:13 But the man who is clean and is not on a journey, yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not present Jehovah's offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.\n9:14 And if a stranger sojourns with you and keeps the passover to Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native born in the land.\n9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony; and in the evening it was like the appearance of fire over the tabernacle until morning.\n9:16 So it was always; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.\n9:17 And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tent, then after that the children of Israel set out; and in the place where the cloud settled, there the children of Israel encamped.\n9:18 At the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel set out, and at the commandment of Jehovah they encamped; as long as the cloud settled upon the tabernacle, they remained encamped.\n9:19 Even when the cloud extended its time over the tabernacle for many days, the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah and did not set out.\n9:20 If sometimes the cloud was upon the tabernacle a few days, according to the commandment of Jehovah they remained encamped; then at the commandment of Jehovah they set out.\n9:21 If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out; or if it remained in the daytime and at night, when the cloud was taken up, they set out.\n9:22 Whether it was two days or a month or a longer time that the cloud extended its time over the tabernacle and settled above it, the children of Israel remained encamped and did not set out; but when it was taken up, they set out.\n9:23 At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they set out. They kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.\n\nNumbers 10\n\n10:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n10:2 Make yourself two trumpets of silver; of beaten work you shall make them; and you shall use them for summoning the assembly and for the setting out of the camps.\n10:3 And when they blow them, all the assembly shall gather themselves to you at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.\n10:4 But if they blow only one, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.\n10:5 And when you blow an alarm, the camps that are encamped on the east side shall set out.\n10:6 And when you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that are encamped on the south side shall set out. They shall blow an alarm for them to set out.\n10:7  But when the congregation is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.\n10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations.\n10:9 And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets, so that you may be remembered before Jehovah your God and be saved from your enemies.\n10:10 Also on your days of rejoicing and at your appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a reminder on your behalf before your God; I am Jehovah your God.\n10:11 Now it was in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle of the Testimony.\n10:12 And the children of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of Sinai. Then the cloud settled down in the wilderness of Paran.\n10:13 And they set out for the first time according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.\n10:14 And the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first according to their companies; and over the entire company was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.\n10:15 And over the company of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.\n10:16 And over the company of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.\n10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who carried the tabernacle, set out.\n10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their companies; and over the entire company was Elizur the son of Shedeur.\n10:19 And over the company of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.\n10:20  And over the company of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.\n10:21 And the Kohathites, who carried the holy things, set out; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.\n10:22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their companies; and over the entire company was Elishama the son of Ammihud.\n10:23 And over the company of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.\n10:24 And over the company of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.\n10:25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set out according to their companies; and over the entire company was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.\n10:26 And over the company of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.\n10:27 And over the company of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.\n10:28 This was the order in which the children of Israel set out according to their companies, when they set out.\n10:29 And Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' fatherinlaw, We are setting out to the place concerning which Jehovah said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will treat you well, for Jehovah has promised good to Israel.\n10:30 But he said to him, I will not go; but rather I will go to my own land and to my relatives.\n10:31 So Moses said, Please do not leave us, for you know where we can encamp in the wilderness, and you will be eyes for us.\n10:32 And if you go with us, whatever good Jehovah does for us, we will do for you.\n10:33 So they set out from the mountain of Jehovah three days' journey, with the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah setting out before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them.\n10:34  And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set out from the camp.\n10:35 And when the Ark set out, Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered; And let those who hate You flee before You.\n10:36 And when it came to rest, he said, Return, O Jehovah, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel. Numbers  11\n11:1 And the people became like those who murmur about their misfortune in the ears of Jehovah; and when Jehovah heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them and consumed some at the outskirts of the camp.\n11:2 And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Jehovah, and the fire abated.\n11:3 And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah had burned among them.\n11:4 And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again and said, Who shall give us meat to eat?\n11:5 We remember the fish which we used to eat in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic;\n11:6 But now our appetite has gone; there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.\n11:7 Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.\n11"));

Or did I bring them forth, so that You should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the nursing child, to the land which You swore to give to their fathers?\n11:13 From where should I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, Give us meat, so that we may eat!\n11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, for it is too heavy for me.\n11:15 And if this is the way You deal with me, please kill me at onceif I have found favor in Your sightand do not let me see my wretchedness.\n11:16 So Jehovah said to Moses, Gather to Me seventy, each one from the elders of Israel, whom you know are the elders of the people and their officers, and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, and have them stand there with you.\n11:17 Then I will come down and talk with you there, and I will take of the Spirit who is upon you and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it alone.\n11:18 And you shall say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore Jehovah will give you meat, and you shall eat.\n11:19 You shall eat not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,\n11:20 But a whole month, until it comes out from your nostrils, and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before Him, saying, Why did we ever come out of Egypt?\n11:21  But Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand on foot; and You have said, I will give them meat so that they may eat a whole month.\n11:22 Will flocks and herds be slain for them, to satisfy them? Or will all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to satisfy them?\n11:23 And Jehovah said to Moses, Has Jehovah's hand become short? Now you will see whether My word will come to pass for you or not.\n11:24 So Moses went out and told the people the words of Jehovah, and he gathered seventy, each one from the elders of the people, and set them around the tent.\n11:25 And Jehovah came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took of the Spirit who was upon him, and put Him upon the seventy elders. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again.\n11:26 But two men had remained in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. (Now they were among those who were registered, but they had not gone out to the tent.) And they prophesied in the camp.\n11:27 And a certain young man ran and told Moses and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.\n11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, restrain them!\n11:29 But Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? Oh that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!\n11:30 And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.\n11:31 And a wind went forth from Jehovah and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey on this side and a day's journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.\n11:32  And the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail. He who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.\n11:33 While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah struck the people with a very severe plague.\n11:34 And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.\n11:35 From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.\n\nNumbers 12\n\n12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman).\n12:2 And they said, Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not also spoken through us? And Jehovah heard it.\n12:3 Now the man Moses was very meek, more than anyone else who was on the surface of the earth.\n12:4 And suddenly Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, You three come out to the Tent of Meeting. So the three of them came out.\n12:5 Then Jehovah came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam. And when they had both come forward,\n12:6 He said, Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, Jehovah, will make Myself known to him in a vision, I will speak with him in a dream.\n12:7 My servant Moses is not so; He is faithful in all My house.\n12:8 With him I speak face to face, even openly, and not in riddles; And he beholds the form of Jehovah. Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?\n12:9  And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them, and He departed.\n12:10 And when the cloud had departed from over the tent; there Miriam was, leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and there she was, leprous.\n12:11 And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please do not lay this sin upon us that we have so foolishly committed.\n12:12 Please do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.\n12:13 And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, Please heal her, O God, please.\n12:14 And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had just spat in her face, would she not bear her shame seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.\n12:15 So Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam had been brought in again.\n12:16 After that the people set out from Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.\n\nNumbers 13\n\n13:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n13:2 Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; one man from each of their fathers' tribes you shall send, every one a leader among them.\n13:3 So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah, all of them leading men among the children of Israel.\n13:4 And these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;\n13:5 From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;\n13:6  From the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;\n13:7 From the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;\n13:8 From the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;\n13:9 From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;\n13:10 From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;\n13:11 From the tribe of Joseph, that is, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;\n13:12 From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;\n13:13 From the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;\n13:14 From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;\n13:15 From the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.\n13:16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.\n13:17 And when Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, Go up this way into the Negev, and go up into the hill country;\n13:18 And see what the land is like; and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;\n13:19 And whether the land in which they dwell is good or bad; and whether the cities that they live in are like camps or with fortifications;\n13:20 And whether the land is fat or lean; whether there are trees in it or not. Therefore strengthen yourselves and bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.\n13:21  So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath.\n13:22 And when they had gone up through the Negev, they came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)\n13:23 Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and from there they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two of them. They also cut off some of the pomegranates and some of the figs.\n13:24 That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.\n13:25 And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.\n13:26 And they proceeded to come to Moses and to Aaron and to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to the whole assembly, and showed them the fruit of the land.\n13:27 And they told him and said, We came to the land into which you sent us; and it indeed flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.\n13:28 However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and we also saw the descendants of Anak there.\n13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negev, and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the hill country, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the Jordan.\n13:30 But Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.\n13:31 But the men who went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.\n13:32 And they brought to the children of Israel an evil report of the land which they had spied out, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants;  and all the people that we saw in it are men of great size.\n13:33 And there we saw the Nephilim (the descendants of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.\n\nNumbers 14\n\n14:1 Then the whole assembly lifted up their voice and cried, and the people wept that night.\n14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole assembly said to them, If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or if only we had died in this wilderness!\n14:3 And why does Jehovah bring us into this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?\n14:4 And they said one to another, Let us appoint a captain, and let us return to Egypt.\n14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the whole congregation of the assembly of the children of Israel.\n14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who spied out the land, tore their clothes;\n14:7 And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we passed to spy out is an exceedingly good land.\n14:8 If Jehovah is pleased with us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.\n14:9 Only do not rebel against Jehovah, nor should you fear the people of the land, for they are our bread. Their protection has been removed from them, and Jehovah is with us; do not fear them.\n14:10 But the whole assembly said to stone them with stones. Then the glory of Jehovah appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.\n14:11 And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people despise Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?\n14:12 I will strike them with pestilence and disposses them, and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they.\n14:13 But Moses said to Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your might You brought up this people from their midst,\n14:14 And they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, Jehovah, are in the midst of this people; for You, O Jehovah, are seen eye to eye, and Your cloud stands over them, and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.\n14:15 Now if You put this people to death as one man, then the nations that have heard the report about You will speak, saying,\n14:16 Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to give them, He has therefore slaughtered them in the wilderness.\n14:17 And now, I pray, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying,\n14:18 Jehovah is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generations.\n14:19 Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.\n14:20 Then Jehovah said, I have pardoned them according to your word;\n14:21 But as surely as I live, and as all the earth will be filled with the glory of Jehovah,\n14:22 None of those men who have seen My glory and My signs, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tried Me these ten times and have not listened to My voice,\n14:23  Shall see the land which I swore to give to their fathers, nor shall any of those who despised Me see it.\n14:24 Only My servant Caleb, because he had a different spirit and has fully followed Me, will I bring into the land which he entered; and his descendants shall take possession of it.\n14:25 Now since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow, and set out into the wilderness by the way that leads to the Red Sea.\n14:26 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n14:27 How long shall I bear with this evil assembly, which murmurs against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they are making against Me.\n14:28 Say to them, As I live, declares Jehovah, just as you have spoken in My ears, so will I do to you.\n14:29 Your corpses shall fall in this wilderness, and none of you"));

just as you do, so he shall do.\n15:15  For the congregation there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.\n15:16 One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.\n15:17 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n15:18 Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land into which I am bringing you,\n15:19 Whenever you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a heave offering to Jehovah.\n15:20 From the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a heave offering; as the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall you offer it up.\n15:21 From the first of your dough you shall give to Jehovah a heave offering throughout your generations.\n15:22 And if you sin unintentionally and do not observe all these commandments which Jehovah has spoken to Moses,\n15:23 That is, everything that Jehovah has commanded you through Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment and onward throughout your generations,\n15:24 Then, if it was done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the assembly, the whole assembly shall offer one bull of the herd for a burnt offering, for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.\n15:25 And the priest shall make expiation for the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven;

Why then do you exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?\n16:4 And when Moses heard this, he fell on his face.\n16:5 And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the morning Jehovah will make known who is His and who is holy, and will bring him near to Himself; even the one whom He will choose He will bring near to Himself.\n16:6 Do this: Take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your company,\n16:7 And put fire in them, and put incense on them before Jehovah tomorrow; and the man whom Jehovah chooses, he shall be holy. It is you who take too much upon yourselves, O sons of Levi!\n16:8 And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, O sons of Levi:\n16:9 Is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to Himself to do the service of the tabernacle of Jehovah and to stand before the assembly to minister to them?\n16:10  Or that He has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And do you seek the priesthood also?\n16:11 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Jehovah; but Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?\n16:12 Then Moses sent word to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab; but they said, We will not come up!\n16:13 Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, but must you also exercise leadership over us?\n16:14 Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!\n16:15 Then Moses became very angry and said to Jehovah, Do not regard their offering. I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them.\n16:16 And Moses said to Korah, You and all your company be present before Jehovah, both you and they along with Aaron, tomorrow.\n16:17 And let each of you take his censer and put incense on them, and each of you present his censer before Jehovah, two hundred fifty censers; you also and Aaron shall each present his censer.\n16:18 So each took his censer and put fire on them and laid incense on them, and they stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.\n16:19 Thus Korah gathered the whole assembly against them at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of Jehovah appeared to the whole assembly.\n16:20 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n16:21 Separate yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may consume them in a moment.\n16:22 But they fell on their faces and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and You be angry with the whole assembly?\n16:23 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n16:24 Speak to the assembly, saying, Get away from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\n16:25 Then Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.\n16:26 And he spoke to the assembly, saying, Depart now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing which belongs to them, or you will be swept away with all their sins.\n16:27 So they got away from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the entrance of their tents, with their wives and their children and their little ones.\n16:28 And Moses said, By this you shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these works, for it is not of myself.\n16:29 If these people die as all human beings die, or if what befalls all human beings befalls them, then Jehovah has not sent me.\n16:30 But if Jehovah brings about a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they descend alive into Sheol, then you will understand that these men have despised Jehovah.\n16:31 And as soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them was split open.\n16:32 So the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with their households and everyone who belonged to Korah and all their possessions.\n16:33 So they and all that belonged to them descended alive into Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the congregation.\n16:34 And all Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, The earth may swallow us up too!\n16:35  And fire came forth from Jehovah and consumed the two hundred fifty men who presented the incense.\n16:36 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n16:37 Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take the censers up out of the burning and scatter the fire about; for they are holy.\n16:38 The censers of those who have sinned against their own lives, let them be made into beaten plates for a covering of the altar, for they presented them before Jehovah and they became holy. So they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.\n16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out as a covering of the altar,\n16:40 As a reminder to the children of Israel that no stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron may come near to burn incense before Jehovah, so that he does not become like Korah and his company, just as Jehovah had spoken to him through Moses.\n16:41 But on the next day the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have caused the people of Jehovah to die.\n16:42 But when the assembly gathered against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the Tent of Meeting, and there the cloud was, covering it; and the glory of Jehovah appeared.\n16:43 And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.\n16:44 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n16:45 Get away from the midst of this assembly that I might consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.\n16:46 And Moses said to Aaron, Take the censer and put fire on it from the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the assembly, and make expiation for them.

So he put on the incense and made expiation for the people.\n16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was stopped.\n16:49 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah.\n16:50 So Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting when the plague had been stopped.\n\nNumbers 17\n\n17:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n17:2 Speak to the children of Israel, and take from them rods, one for each father's house, twelve rods from all their leaders according to their fathers' houses; you shall write everyone's name upon his rod.\n17:3 And you shall write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of each of their fathers' houses.\n17:4 And you shall place them in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.\n17:5 And the rod of the man whom I choose shall bud, and I will put a stop to the murmurings of the children of Israel against Me, which they murmur against you.\n17:6 So Moses spoke to the children of Israel. And every one of their leaders gave him a rod, one rod for each leader according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods.\n17:7 And Moses placed the rods before Jehovah in the Tent of the Testimony.\n17:8  And on the next day Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony, and there was the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi: it had budded; it even put forth buds and produced blossoms and bore ripe almonds.\n17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel, and they looked; and each one took his rod.\n17:10 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony to be kept as a sign against the rebels, so that you may put an end to their murmurings against Me, and they not die.\n17:11 And Moses did so; just as Jehovah commanded him, so he did.\n17:12 And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Alas, we die out; we perish; all of us perish.\n17:13 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Jehovah, dies. Are we to completely die out?\n\nNumbers 18\n\n18:1 Then Jehovah said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father's household with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.\n18:2 And your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with you, so that they may be joined to you and minister to you, while you and your sons with you are before the Tent of the Testimony.\n18:3 And they shall keep your charge and the charge of all the tent, but they shall not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and to the altar, so that they do not die, neither they nor you.\n18:4 And they shall be joined to you and keep the charge of the Tent of Meeting for all the service of the tent, but a stranger shall not come near to you.\n18:5 And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, so that there may be no more wrath upon the children of Israel.\n18:6  And I Myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel. They are a gift to you, given to Jehovah, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting.\n18:7 But you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and within the veil, and you shall carry out your service. I give you the priesthood as a service of gift, but the unauthorized person who comes near shall be put to death.\n18:8 Then Jehovah spoke to Aaron, And I Myself have given you charge of My heave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel; I have given them to you because of the anointing, and to your sons, as a perpetual statute.\n18:9 This shall be yours of the most holy things, kept from the fire. Every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.\n18:10 As the most holy things you shall eat it; every male shall eat it; it shall be holy to you.\n18:11 This also is yours, the heave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a perpetual statute; everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.\n18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of new wine and of the grain, their firstfruits that they give to Jehovah, I have given to you.\n18:13 The firstfruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Jehovah, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.\n18:14 Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.\n18:15 Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, which they present to Jehovah, whether human or animal, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of human beings you shall surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.\n18:16 And those who are to be redeemed from a month old you shall redeem, according to your estimation, for five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.\n18:17  But the firstborn of a cow or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar and burn their fat as an offering by fire for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.\n18:18 But their flesh shall be yours; like the breast of the wave offering and like the right thigh, it shall be yours.\n18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to Jehovah, I have given to you and to your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual statute. It is a covenant of salt forever before Jehovah for you and for your descendants with you.\n18:20 And Jehovah said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.\n18:21 And to the children of Levi I have now given every tithe in Israel for an inheritance in return for their service which they carry out, the service of the Tent of Meeting.\n18:22 From now on the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, so that they do not incur sin and die.\n18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations. And among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.\n18:24 For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave offering to Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.\n18:25 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n18:26 Moreover you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, When you take from the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer up a heave offering from it for Jehovah, a tithe of the tithe.\n18:27 And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor and the fullness of the wine press.\n18:28  Thus you shall also offer a heave offering to Jehovah from all your tithes, which you receive from the children of Israel; and from it you shall give Jehovah's heave offering to Aaron the priest.\n18:29 Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of Jehovah, from all the best of it, the sanctified portion of it from them.\n18:30 Therefore you shall say to them, When you heave from it the best of it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as though it were the produce of the threshing floor and the produce of the wine press.\n18:31 And you may eat it in every place, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting.\n18:32 And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it. But you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, so that you do not die.\n\nNumbers 19\n\n19:1 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n19:2 This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the children of Israel to bring you a red heifer without defect, in which is no blemish and upon which a yoke has never come.\n19:3 And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring it outside the camp, and one shall slaughter it in his presence.\n19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle its blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times.\n19:5 And the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its skin and its flesh and its blood, with its dung, shall be burned.\n19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet strands, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.\n19:7  Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; but the priest shall be unclean until the evening.\n19:8 And he who burns the heifer shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.\n19:9 And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and place them outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the assembly of the children of Israel as water for impurity; it is a sin offering.\n19:10 And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be a perpetual statute to the children of Israel and to the stranger who sojourns among them.\n19:11 One who touches the dead body of any human being shall be unclean seven days.\n19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day, and then he shall be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.\n19:13 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a human being who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.\n19:14 This is the law when a man dies in a tent: Anyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.\n19:15 And every open vessel, which has no covering tied down on it, is unclean.\n19:16 And whoever in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or a dead body or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.\n19:17 And for the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering, and running water shall be added to them in a vessel;\n19:18  And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there, or on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one who died or the grave.\n19:19 And the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day, and on the seventh day he shall purify him. And he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean in the evening.\n19:20 But the man who shall be unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah; the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.\n19:21 So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.\n19:22 And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.\n\nNumbers 20\n\n20:1 Then the children of Israel, the whole assembly, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed at Kadesh; and Miriam died there and was buried there.\n20:2 And there was no water for the assembly, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.\n20:3 And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying, If only we had expired when our brothers expired before Jehovah!\n20:4 Why then have you brought the congregation of Jehovah into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die there?\n20:5 Why then did you bring us up out of Egypt, to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is not even water to drink.\n20:6  And Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and fell upon their faces, and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.\n20:7 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n20:8 Take the rod, and gather the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, so that it yields its water. Thus you shall bring forth water for them out of the rock and give the assembly and their livestock a drink.\n20:9 And Moses took the rod from before Jehovah, as He had commanded him.\n20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Listen now, you rebels: Shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?\n20:11 Then Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his rod twice; and abundant water came forth, and the assembly and their livestock drank.\n20:12 And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the sight of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.\n20:13 These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of Israel contended with Jehovah, and He was sanctified among them.\n20:14 Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: Thus says your brother Israel, You know all the hardship that has befallen us;\n20:15 How our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians illtreated us and our fathers;\n20:16 And when we cried to Jehovah, He heard our voice and sent an Angel and brought us forth out of Egypt; and now we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border.\n20:17 Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, nor will we drink water from any well; we will go along the King's Highway, not turning aside to the right or to the left, until we pass through your territory.\n20:18  But Edom said to him, You shall not pass through my territory, or else I will come out against you with the sword.\n20:19 Then the children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highwa"));

Allow me only this one thing, to pass through on foot.\n20:20 However he said, You shall not pass through. And Edom came out against him with a large number of people and with a mighty hand.\n20:21 So Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, and Israel turned away from him.\n20:22 Now when they journeyed from Kadesh, the children of Israel, the whole assembly, came to Mount Hor.\n20:23 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,\n20:24 Aaron shall be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My word at the waters of Meribah.\n20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up Mount Hor;\n20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments and put them upon Eleazar his son; so Aaron will be gathered to his people, and will die there.\n20:27 So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded, and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole assembly.\n20:28 And when Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son, Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.\n20:29 And when the whole assembly saw that Aaron had expired, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.\n\nNumbers 21\n\n21:1 And when the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who dwelt in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.\n21:2 And Israel made a vow to Jehovah and said, If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.\n21:3 And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. Thus the name of the place was called Hormah.\n21:4 Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient on the way.\n21:5 And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread.\n21:6 Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.\n21:7 And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah and against you; pray to Jehovah, that He may take away the serpents from us. So Moses prayed for the people.\n21:8 Then Jehovah said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.\n21:9 And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the pole; and if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.\n21:10 And the children of Israel journeyed and encamped at Oboth.\n21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth and encamped at Iyeabarim in the wilderness which faces Moab toward the sunrise.\n21:12 From there they journeyed and encamped in the valley of Zered.\n21:13  From there they journeyed and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.\n21:14 Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah, Waheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,\n21:15 And the slope of the valleys That inclines toward the seat of Ar And leans toward the border of Moab.\n21:16 And from there they journeyed to Beer; that is the well where Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.\n21:17 Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! Sing to it!\n21:18 The well, which the leaders sank, Which the nobles of the people dug, With the scepter, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they journeyed to Mattanah;\n21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;\n21:20 And from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down upon the desert.\n21:21 And Israel sent messengers to Sihon the king of the Amorites, saying,\n21:22 Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or into vineyard; we will not drink water from any well. We will go by the King's Highway, until we have passed through your territory.\n21:23 But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. And Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.\n21:24 And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.\n21:25  And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all her villages.\n21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.\n21:27 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, Come to Heshbon; let it be built, And let the city of Sihon be established.\n21:28 For fire has gone forth from Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon; It has consumed Ar of Moab, And swallowed up the high places of the Arnon.\n21:29 Woe to you, O Moab! You have perished, O people of Chemosh; He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters have gone into captivity, To an Amorite king, Sihon.\n21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon, And we have laid waste as far as Nophah, Fire spreads as far as Medeba.\n21:31 Thus Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.\n21:32 And Moses sent some to spy out Jazer. And they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.\n21:33 And they turned and went up on the way that leads to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei.\n21:34 And Jehovah said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who was dwelling at Heshbon.\n21:35 So they struck him and his sons and all his people until there was no remnant left to him, and they possessed his land.\n\nNumbers 22\n\n22:1  And the children of Israel journeyed and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.\n22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.\n22:3 And Moab was very afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.\n22:4 And Moab said to the elders of Midian, This multitude will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. Now Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.\n22:5 And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, There is a people here who have come out from Egypt; now they cover the surface of the land and have settled over against me.\n22:6 Now, therefore, please come; curse this people for me, since they are mightier than I. Perhaps I may be able to strike them and drive them out of the land, for I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed.\n22:7 So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with fees for divination in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.\n22:8 And he said to them, Spend tonight here, and I will bring back word to you as Jehovah speaks to me. And the rulers of Moab stayed with Balaam.\n22:9 And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?\n22:10 And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, has sent word to me, saying,\n22:11 There is a people who came out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land. Now come; curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them out.\n22:12 And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.\n22:13 So Balaam rose up in the morning and said to the rulers from Balak, Go to your land, for Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.\n22:14 And the rulers of Moab rose up and went to Balak and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.\n22:15 So Balak yet again sent rulers, more numerous and more honorable than these.\n22:16 And they came to Balaam and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,\n22:17 For I will indeed honor you greatly; and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore; curse this people for me.\n22:18 And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.\n22:19 Now you therefore please stay here tonight also, so that I may know what more Jehovah might speak to me.\n22:20 And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, Since the men have come to call you, rise up; go with them, but only what I speak to you shall you do.\n22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the rulers of Moab.\n22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he was going, and the Angel of Jehovah took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.\n22:23 And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way.\n22:24 Then the Angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.\n22:25 And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she pressed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall. So he struck her again.\n22:26  And the Angel of Jehovah went further and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.\n22:27 And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she lay down under Balaam. Then Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.\n22:28 And Jehovah opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?\n22:29 And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.\n22:30 And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you? And he said, No.\n22:31 Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and he bowed his head and fell on his face.\n22:32 And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? I am here, having come out as an adversary, because your way was unrestrained before Me.\n22:33 And the donkey saw Me and turned aside before Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, I would surely have killed you just now and let her live.\n22:34 And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I did not know that You were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it displeases You, I will turn back.\n22:35 And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men; but you shall speak only the word that I shall speak to you. So Balaam went with the rulers from Balak.\n22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, at the farthest point of the border.\n22:37 And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not send word urgently to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not indeed able to honor you?\n22:38  And Balaam said to Balak, Here I am; I have come to you now. Am I able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.\n22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriathhuzoth.\n22:40 And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent them to Balaam and to the rulers who were with him.\n22:41 And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth baal, and he saw from there the edge of the people.\n\nNumbers 23\n\n23:1 Then Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here.\n23:2 And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken. And Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.\n23:3 And Balaam said to Balak, Stand near your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you. And he went to a bare height.\n23:4 And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.\n23:5 And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, Return to Balak, and you shall speak this.\n23:6 When he returned to him, there he was, standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the rulers of Moab.\n23:7 And he took up his parable and said, From Aram Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me; And come, denounce Israel!\n23:8 How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? And how can I denounce whom Jehovah has not denounced?\n23:9  For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him. Here is a people who live alone And do not reckon themselves among the nations.\n23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the upright, And let my latter end be like theirs!\n23:11 And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed them.\n23:12 And he answered and said, Shall I not take care to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?\n23:13 And Balak said to him, Come now with me to another place from which you may see them. You will see only the outside edge of them and not see them all; then curse them for me from there.\n23:14 So he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.\n23:15 And he said to Balak, Stand here near your burnt offering, while I meet Jehovah there.\n23:16 And Jehovah met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, Return to Balak, and you shall speak this.\n23:17 When he came to him, there he was, standing beside his burnt offering, and the rulers of Moab with him.

They shall not lie down until they eat the prey And drink the blood of the slain.\n23:25 And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.\n23:26 But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell you, saying, All that Jehovah speaks, that I must do?\n23:27 And Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.\n23:28 And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks down upon the desert.\n23:29 And Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here.\n23:30 And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.\n\nNumbers 24\n\n24:1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did not go as at the other times to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.\n24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him.\n24:3 And he took up his parable and said, Balaam the son of Beor declares, And the man whose eye is opened declares;\n24:4 He declares, he who hears the words of God, Who sees the vision of the Allsufficient One, Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:\n24:5 How fair are your tents, O Jacob, Your tabernacles, O Israel!\n24:6 Like valleys they are spread forth, Like gardens beside a river, Like aloes which Jehovah has planted, Like cedars beside water.\n24:7 Water shall flow from his buckets, And his seed shall be in many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his kingdom shall be exalted.\n24:8 God is the One who brought him forth out of Egypt; He has as it were the horns of the wild ox.

afterward you will be gathered to your people.\n31:3 And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm men from among you for the war, that they may come upon Midian to execute Jehovah's vengeance on Midian.\n31:4 A thousand from each tribe, of all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war.\n31:5 So out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand for each tribe were committed, twelve thousand armed for war.\n31:6 And Moses sent them, a thousand for each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest with them, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.\n31:7 And they warred against Midian, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses; and they killed every male.\n31:8 And they killed the kings of Midian in addition to the others slain among them: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; also Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword.\n31:9 And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and all their cattle and all their livestock and all their goods they plundered.\n31:10 And all their cities in which they had settled and all their encampments, they burned with fire.\n31:11 And they took all the spoil and all the booty, both of man and of beast.\n31:12 And they brought the captives and the booty and the spoil to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the assembly of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab, which was beside the Jordan at Jericho.\n31:13  And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the assembly went out to meet them outside the camp.\n31:14 And Moses became angry with the officers of the company, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from service in the war.\n31:15 And Moses said to them, Have you kept all the women alive?\n31:16 It was these who caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to act unfaithfully against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, so that the plague came upon the assembly of Jehovah.\n31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by lying with him.\n31:18 But all the little ones among the women, who have not known a male by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.\n31:19 And you, encamp outside the camp seven days, everyone who has killed any person and everyone who has touched any slain; purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives.\n31:20 And you shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of skin and everything made of goats' hair and every article of wood.\n31:21 And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded Moses:\n31:22 Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,\n31:23 Everything that can go into the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it will become clean; but it shall be purified with the water for impurity; and everything that cannot go into the fire you shall pass through the water.\n31:24 And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you may come into the camp.\n31:25 Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,\n31:26 You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers' households of the assembly, take the sum of the booty that was captured, both of man and of beast,\n31:27 And halve the booty between those skilled in war who went out to battle and the whole assembly.\n31:28 And levy a tribute to Jehovah from the men of war who went out to battle: one living thing out of five hundred, of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the flock;\n31:29 Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Jehovah's heave offering.\n31:30 And of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one seized out of fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, from all the beasts, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.\n31:31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah commanded Moses.\n31:32 Now the booty that was left from the spoil which the men of war took was six hundred seventyfive thousand sheep,\n31:33 And seventytwo thousand cattle,\n31:34 And sixtyone thousand donkeys,\n31:35 And thirtytwo thousand persons in all, the women who had not known lying with a male.\n31:36 And the half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred thirtyseven thousand five hundred sheep.\n31:37 And Jehovah's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventyfive.\n31:38 And the cattle were thirtysix thousand, of which Jehovah's tribute was seventytwo.\n31:39 And the donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which Jehovah's tribute was sixtyone.\n31:40 And the human beings were sixteen thousand, of whom Jehovah's tribute was thirtytwo persons.\n31:41  And Moses gave the tribute, Jehovah's heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n31:42 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses had separated from the men who had gone to war\n31:43 ( That is, the assembly's half was three hundred thirtyseven thousand five hundred sheep,\n31:44 And thirtysix thousand cattle,\n31:45 And thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,\n31:46 ) And sixteen thousand persons\n31:47 Now Moses took from the children of Israel's half, one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.\n31:48 And the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses.\n31:49 And they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge, and not a man is missing from us;\n31:50 And we have presented Jehovah's offering, what every man has obtained, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and pendants, to make expiation for our souls before Jehovah.\n31:51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of wrought articles.\n31:52 And all the gold of the heave offering which they offered up to Jehovah, from the captains of thousands and from the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.\n31:53 The men of war had taken booty, each for himself.\n31:54 So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.\n\nNumbers 32\n\n32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great abundance of livestock. And when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that the place was indeed a place for livestock,\n32:2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the assembly, saying,\n32:3 Ataroth and Dibon and Jazer and Nimrah and Heshbon and Elealeh and Sebam and Nebo and Beon,\n32:4 The land which Jehovah struck before the assembly of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.\n32:5 And they said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession; do not make us cross over the Jordan.\n32:6 And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, while you stay here?\n32:7 Now why would you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from crossing over into the land which Jehovah has given them?\n32:8 Your fathers did this when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.\n32:9 When they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel from going into the land which Jehovah had given them.\n32:10 And Jehovah's anger was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying,\n32:11 Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not fully followed Me;\n32:12  Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have fully followed Jehovah.\n32:13 And Jehovah's anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation which had done evil in the sight of Jehovah was consumed.\n32:14 And now you have risen up in your fathers' place, a brood of sinful men, to further increase the burning anger of Jehovah toward Israel.\n32:15 For if you turn away from following Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy this entire people.\n32:16 And they came near to him and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones;\n32:17 But we ourselves will be armed and ready to go before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.\n32:18 We will not return to our houses until each one of the children of Israel has inherited his inheritance.\n32:19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and further on, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.\n32:20 And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves before Jehovah for war,\n32:21 And all of your armed men will cross over the Jordan before Jehovah until He has driven out His enemies from before Him,\n32:22 And the land is subdued before Jehovah, then afterward you shall return and be free of obligation toward Jehovah and toward Israel; and this land shall be yours for a possession before Jehovah.\n32:23 But if you will not do so, then you have sinned against Jehovah; and know that your sin will find you out.\n32:24  Build for yourselves cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.\n32:25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.\n32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle will be there in the cities of Gilead;\n32:27 But your servants will cross over, everyone who is armed for war before Jehovah to battle, as my lord says.\n32:28 So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children of Israel.\n32:29 And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, everyone who is armed to battle before Jehovah, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession.\n32:30 But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.\n32:31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah has said to your servants, so will we do.\n32:32 We will cross over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance will remain with us beyond the Jordan.\n32:33 And Moses gave to them, to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben and to the halftribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, the land according to its cities with their territories, the cities of the surrounding land.\n32:34 And the children of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer\n32:35 And Atrothshophan and Jazer and Jogbehah\n32:36 And Bethnimrah and Bethharan as fortified cities, and folds for sheep.\n32:37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim\n32:38 And Nebo and Baalmeontheir names to be changedand Sibmah, and they gave other names to the cities which they built.\n32:39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.\n32:40 And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelt in it.\n32:41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its villages and called them Havvothjair.\n32:42 And Nobah went and took Kenath and its towns, and called it Nobah after his own name.\n\nNumbers 33\n\n33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they went forth out of the land of Egypt by their companies under the direction of Moses and Aaron.\n33:2 And Moses wrote down the places that they went out from for their journeys according to the commandment of Jehovah;

The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he encounters him.\n35:22 But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or threw upon him anything without lying in wait,\n35:23 Or came upon him with any stone, by which someone could die, without seeing him and dropped it upon him, and he died, when he was not his enemy and did not seek his harm,\n35:24 Then the assembly shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.\n35:25 And the assembly shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the assembly shall return him to his city of refuge to which he had fled; and he shall dwell in it until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.\n35:26 But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the boundary of his city of refuge to which he has fled,\n35:27 And the avenger of blood finds him outside the boundary of his city of refuge and the avenger of blood slays the manslayer, he shall not have guilt for blood,\n35:28 Because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.\n35:29 And these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.\n35:30 Whoever kills a person, the murderer shall be slain upon the testimony of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against any person so that he die.\n35:31 Moreover you shall not take a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.\n35:32 And you shall not take a ransom for one who has fled to his city of refuge, so that he may return to live in the land before the death of the high priest.\n35:33  Thus you shall not pollute the land in which you are, for blood pollutes the land. And no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it.\n35:34 And you shall not defile the land in which you are dwelling, in the midst of which I tabernacle; for I Jehovah tabernacle in the midst of the children of Israel.\n\nNumbers 36\n\n36:1 And the heads of the fathers' households of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers' house holds of the children of Israel;\n36:2 And they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.\n36:3 But if they are married to one of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.\n36:4 And when the jubilee of the children of Israel takes place, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance "));
